  abstract = {Data compression techniques are commonly used to achieve a low bit rate in the digital representation of signals for efficient processing, transmission, and storage. In this paper, a new technique for lossless compression of seismic data is introduced. The technique consists of two stages. The first stage is a modified linear prediction with discrete coefficients that is developed based on the assumption that the seismic data can be modeled as a sum of finite number of complex sinusoids in additive noise. In the second stage, the parameters and residual sequence of seismic data model are bi-level coded. Experimental results performed using real seismic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new modeling approach.},

  abstract = {A seismic moment tensor is a 3 \texttimes{} 3 symmetric matrix that provides a compact representation of a seismic source. We develop an algorithm to estimate moment tensors and their uncertainties from observed seismic data. For a given event, the algorithm performs a grid search over the six-dimensional space of moment tensors by generating synthetic waveforms for each moment tensor and then evaluating a misfit function between the observed and synthetic waveforms. ``The'' moment tensor M0 for the event is then the moment tensor with minimum misfit. To describe the uncertainty associated with M0, we first convert the misfit function to a probability function. The uncertainty, or rather the confidence, is then given by the ``confidence curve'' \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} (V), where \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} (V) is the probability that the true moment tensor for the event lies within a certain neighborhood of M that has fractional volume V. The area under the confidence curve provides a single, abbreviated ``confidence parameter'' for M0. We apply the method to data from events in different regions and tectonic settings: 17 nuclear explosions and 12 earthquakes at the Nevada Test Site, 63 small (Mw {$<$} 2.5) events at Uturuncu volcano in Bolivia, and 21 moderate (Mw {$>$} 4) earthquakes in the southern Alaska subduction zone. Characterization of moment tensor uncertainties puts us in better position to discriminate among moment tensor source types and to assign physical processes to the events.},

  abstract = {Exploring the impact of the heterogeneous lower mantle on the geodynamo requires knowledge of the heat flux anomaly across the core-mantle boundary. Most studies so far used a purely thermal interpretation of seismic shear wave anomalies to assign heterogeneous heat flux boundary conditions on numerical dynamo models, ignoring phase transition or compositional origins. A recent study of mantle convection (Nakagawa and Tackley, 2008) provides guidelines to include such non-thermal effects. Here we construct maps of heat flux across the core-mantle boundary based on a lower mantle tomography model (Masters et al., 2000) with a combined thermal and post-Perovskite phase transition interpretation. We impose these patterns as outer boundary conditions on numerical dynamo simulations and study the impact of accounting for post-Perovskite effects on the long-term time-average properties of the dynamo. We then compare our results with geophysical observations. We find in all cases that surface downwellings associated with cyclones concentrate intense non-axisymmetric magnetic flux at high-latitudes, the surface flow contains a large anticlockwise vortex at mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere, and the inner boundary buoyancy flux is dominated by a Y20 pattern. Boundary-driven time-average surface flow with some equatorial asymmetry is organized in the shell by quasi-axial convective rolls that extract more buoyancy from low-latitudes of the inner-boundary. These positive inner boundary buoyancy flux structures are found at low-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, in some places due to cyclonic flow at mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere connecting with higher latitude cyclonic flow in the northern hemisphere. Accounting for post-Perovskite effects improves the recovery of several geodynamo observations, including the Atlantic/Pacific hemispherical dichotomy in core flow activity, the single intense paleomagnetic field structure in the southern hemisphere, and possibly the m = 1 dominant mode of inner-core seismic heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Lower mantle heterogeneity could cause deviations from axial symmetry in geodynamo properties. Global tomography models are commonly used to infer the pattern of core\textendash mantle boundary heat flux via a linear relation that corresponds to a purely thermal interpretation of lower mantle seismic anomalies, ignoring both non-thermal origins and non-resolved small scales. Here we study the possible impact on the geodynamo of narrow thermal anomalies in the base of the mantle, originating from either compositional heterogeneity or sharp margins of large-scale features. A heat flux boundary condition composed of a large-scale pattern and narrow ridges separating the large-scale positive and negative features is imposed on numerical dynamos. We find that hot ridges located to the west of a positive large-scale core\textendash mantle boundary heat flux anomaly produce a time-average narrow elongated upwelling, a flow barrier at the top of the core and intensified low-latitudes magnetic flux patches. When the ridge is located to the east of a positive core\textendash mantle boundary heat flux anomaly, the associated upwelling is weaker and the homogeneous dynamo westward drift leaks, precluding persistent intense low-latitudes magnetic flux patches. These signatures of the core\textendash mantle boundary heat flux ridge are evident in the north\textendash south component of the thermal wind balance. Based on the pattern of lower mantle seismic tomography (Masters et al., 2000), we hypothesize that hot narrow thermal ridges below central Asia and the Indian Ocean and below the American Pacific coast produce time-average fluid upwelling and a barrier for azimuthal flow at the top of the core. East of these ridges, below east Asia and Oceania and below the Americas, time-average intense geomagnetic flux patches are expected.},

  abstract = {Mantle control on planetary dynamos is often studied by imposing heterogeneous core-mantle boundary (CMB) heat flux patterns on the outer boundary of numerical dynamo simulations. These patterns typically enter two main categories: Either they are proportional to seismic tomography models of Earth's lowermost mantle to simulate realistic conditions, or they are represented by single spherical harmonics for fundamental physical understanding. However, in reality the dynamics in the lower mantle is much more complicated and these CMB heat flux models are most likely oversimplified. Here we term alternative any CMB heat flux pattern imposed on numerical dynamos that does not fall into these two categories, and instead attempts to account for additional complexity in the lower mantle. We review papers that attempted to explain various dynamo-related observations by imposing alternative CMB heat flux patterns on their dynamo models. For present-day Earth, the alternative patterns reflect non-thermal contributions to seismic anomalies or sharp features not resolved by global tomography models. Time-dependent mantle convection is invoked for capturing past conditions on Earth's CMB. For Mars, alternative patterns account for localized heating by a giant impact or a mantle plume. Recovered geodynamo-related observations include persistent morphological features of present-day core convection and the geomagnetic field as well as the variability in the geomagnetic reversal frequency over the past several hundred Myr. On Mars the models aim at explaining the demise of the paleodynamo or the hemispheric crustal magnetic dichotomy. We report the main results of these studies, discuss their geophysical implications, and speculate on some future prospects.},

Recent progress has clearly identified sources of microseisms in the most energetic band, with periods from 3 to 10 s. In contrast, the generation of longer-period microseisms has been strongly debated. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain seismic wave generation: a primary mechanism, by which ocean waves propagating over bottom slopes generate seismic waves, and a secondary mechanism which relies on the nonlinear interaction of ocean waves. Here we show that the primary mechanism explains the average power, frequency distribution, and most of the variability in signals recorded by vertical seismometers, for seismic periods ranging from 13 to 300 s. The secondary mechanism only explains seismic motions with periods shorter than 13 s. Our results build on a quantitative numerical model that gives access to time-varying maps of seismic noise sources.},

  abstract = {The goal of an investigation, scientific or otherwise, is usually to find answers to some specific set of questions about the state of nature: what is the seismic velocity structure? How likely is this volcano to erupt within a certain period? Does a subsurface reservoir contain resources of interest? Background research may reveal the existence of pertinent knowledge and information discovered previously, new data are normally acquired, and an inference problem is solved in order to answer the questions taking both all of the a priori information and the new data into account. Inverse theory, decision theory and the theory of experimental design provide methods to optimize the design of the investigation and to estimate results. However, those theories are normally set in the context of a particular model of the universe, with its particular parametrization. This requires the investigator to specify a priori a coherent utility (a function that describes the risks and rewards) of all possible outcomes under that parametrization. Quite commonly, the investigator may not be able to do this. Ideally an investigator would be able merely to pose a set of questions, define a set of constraints on the data types, acquisition costs and logistics, and provide a functional to relate the questions to any particular parameter space. Theory and methodology would then semi-autonomously drive the interrogation of the state of nature by optimally selecting one or more relevant models and parameter spaces, and designing, acquiring and analysing data, in order to best answer the questions. If necessary this could be done in a sequential or iterative manner, which potentially then involves changing the questions posed in each iteration based on both previous results and inspiration from the investigator. We present such a theory of interrogation in this paper. We review the relevant aspects of decision and design theory, and cast them in a framework where the investigator specifies a utility only at the level required by the general questions to be posed. Each model under consideration is then mapped into this utility space of possible answers. We then extend this framework to sequential investigations, where the outcome of each step may affect all aspects of the problem: the models entertained, the utilities and even the questions themselves. A variety of examples illustrates the generality of this method: an asset team investigating how best to exploit a subsurface reservoir, Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the Bayesian evidence for geophysical models, discriminating between different rock physics models of strain in laboratory deformation experiments, an organization sequentially assessing the effectiveness of its methods to evaluate subsurface assets, assessing whether subsurface CO2 storage should be promoted for climate change mitigation, and examples running through the text of seismic tomography, earthquake characterization and autonomous interplanetary robotic exploration.},

We employ ray-theoretical sensitivity functions to relate surface wave and body wave data with radially anisotropic velocity perturbations. Our database includes surface wave phase delays from fundamental modes up to the sixth overtone, measured at periods between 25 and 350 s, as well as cross-correlation traveltimes of major body wave phases. Before inversion, we apply crustal corrections using the crustal model CRUST2.0, and we account for azimuthal anisotropy in the upper mantle using ray-theoretical corrections based on a global model of azimuthal anisotropy. While being well correlated with earlier models at long spatial wavelength, our preferred solution, savani, additionally delineates a number of previously unidentified structures due to its improved resolution in areas of dense coverage. This is because the density of the inverse grid ranges between 1.25{$\smwhtcircle$} in well-sampled and 5{$\smwhtcircle$} in poorly sampled regions, allowing us to resolve regional structure better than it is typically the case in global S wave tomography. Our model highlights (i) a distinct ocean-continent anisotropic signature in the uppermost mantle, (ii) an oceanic peak in above average \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} {$<$} 1 which is shallower than in previous models and thus in better agreement with estimates of lithosphere thickness, and (iii) a long-wavelength pattern of \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} {$<$} 1 associated with the large low-shear velocity provinces in the lowermost mantle.},

  abstract = {The EarthScope USArray provides an opportunity to obtain detailed images of the continental upper mantle at an unprecedented scale. The majority of mantle models derived from USArray data to date contain spatial variations in seismic-wave speed; however, in many cases these data sets do not by themselves allow a non-unique interpretation. Joint interpretation of seismic attenuation and velocity models can improve upon the interpretations based only on velocity and provide important constraints on the temperature, composition, melt content, and volatile content of the mantle. The surface wave amplitudes that constrain upper-mantle attenuation are sensitive to factors in addition to attenuation, including the earthquake source excitation, focusing and defocusing by elastic structure, and local site amplification. Because of the difficulty of isolating attenuation from these other factors, little is known about the attenuation structure of the North American upper mantle. In this study, Rayleigh wave traveltime and amplitude in the period range 25\textendash 100 s are measured using an interstation cross-correlation technique, which takes advantage of waveform similarity at nearby stations. Several estimates of Rayleigh wave attenuation and site amplification are generated at each period, using different approaches to separate the effects of attenuation and local site amplification on amplitude. It is assumed that focusing and defocusing effects can be described by the Laplacian of the traveltime field. All approaches identify the same large-scale patterns in attenuation, including areas where the attenuation values are likely contaminated by unmodelled focusing and defocusing effects. Regionally averaged attenuation maps are constructed after removal of the contaminated attenuation values, and the variations in intrinsic shear attenuation that are suggested by these Rayleigh wave attenuation maps are explored.},

  abstract = {Calving of icebergs is an important component of mass loss from the polar ice sheets and glaciers in many parts of the world. Calving rates can increase dramatically in response to increases in velocity and/or retreat of the glacier margin, with important implications for sea level change. Despite their importance, calving and related dynamic processes are poorly represented in the current generation of ice sheet models. This is largely because understanding the 'calving problem' involves several other long-standing problems in glaciology, combined with the difficulties and dangers of field data collection. In this paper, we systematically review different aspects of the calving problem, and outline a new framework for representing calving processes in ice sheet models. We define a hierarchy of calving processes, to distinguish those that exert a fundamental control on the position of the ice margin from more localised processes responsible for individual calving events. The first-order control on calving is the strain rate arising from spatial variations in velocity (particularly sliding speed), which determines the location and depth of surface crevasses. Superimposed on this first-order process are second-order processes that can further erode the ice margin. These include: fracture propagation in response to local stress imbalances in the immediate vicinity of the glacier front; undercutting of the glacier terminus by melting at or below the waterline; and bending at the junction between grounded and buoyant parts of an ice tongue. Calving of projecting, submerged 'ice feet' can be regarded as a third-order process, because it is paced by first- or second-order calving above the waterline. First-order calving can be represented in glacier models using a calving criterion based on crevasse depth, which is a function of longitudinal strain rate. Modelling changes in terminus position and calving rates thus reduces to the problem of determining the ice geometry and velocity distribution. Realistic solutions to the problem of modelling ice flow therefore depend critically on an appropriate choice of sliding law. Models that assume that basal velocities are controlled by basal drag can replicate much of the observed behaviour of calving glaciers with grounded termini, but an important limitation is that they cannot be used to model floating glacier termini or ice shelves. Alternative sliding laws that parameterise drag from the glacier margins provide more flexible and robust ways of representing calving in ice sheet models. Such models can explain a remarkable range of observed phenomena within a simple, unifying framework, including: downglacier increases in velocity and strain rates where basal and/or lateral drag diminishes; flow acceleration in response to thinning through time; the tendency for glaciers to stabilise at 'pinning points' in relatively shallow water or fjord narrowings; the constraints on ice shelf stability; and the contrasts in calving rates between tidewater and freshwater calving glaciers. Many unresolved issues remain, however, including the role played by the removal of backstress in the acceleration of retreating calving glaciers, and the controls on melting at and below the waterline.

  abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging field of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency\textendash time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be flexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a significant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity and phase velocities, from both ambient noise and earthquake measurements, along with receiver functions to create a shear wave velocity model. We also use a follow-up phase velocity inversion to resolve interstation structure. By comparing our results to previous tomography, geology, and geophysical studies we are able to validate our findings and connect localized near-surface studies with deeper, regional models. Specifically, we are able to resolve shallow basins, including the Copper River, Cook Inlet, Yukon Flats, Nenana, and a variety of other shallower basins. Additionally, we gain insight on the interaction between the upper mantle wedge, asthenosphere, and active and nonactive volcanism along the Aleutians and Denali volcanic gap, respectively. We observe thicker crust beneath the Brooks Range and south of the Denali fault within the Wrangellia Composite Terrane and thinner crust in the Yukon Composite Terrane in interior Alaska. We also gain new perspective on the Wrangell Volcanic Field and its interaction between surrounding asthenosphere and the Yakutat Terrane.},

  abstract = {A self-consistent regional-scale seismic velocity model with resolution from seismogenic depth to the surface is crucial for seismic hazard assessment. Though Southern California is the most seismically imaged region in the world, techniques with high near-surface sensitivity have been applied only in disparate local areas and have not been incorporated into a unified model with deeper resolution. In the present work, we obtain isotropic values for Rayleigh wave phase velocity and ellipticity in Southern California by cross-correlating daily time series from the year 2015 across 315 regional stations in period ranges 6 to 18 s. Leveraging the complementary sensitivity of the two Rayleigh wave data sets, we combine H/V and phase velocity measurements to determine a new 3-D shear velocity model in a Bayesian joint inversion framework. The new model has greatly improved shallow resolution compared to the Southern California Earthquake Center CVMS4.26 reference model. Well-known large-scale features common to previous studies are resolved, including velocity contrasts across the San Andreas, San Jacinto, Garlock, and Elsinore faults, midcrustal high-velocity structure beneath the Mojave Desert, and shallow Moho beneath the Salton Trough. Other prominent features that have previously only been imaged in focused local studies include the correct sedimentary thickness of the southern Central Valley, fold structure of the Ventura and Oak Ridge Anticlines, and velocity contrast across the Newport-Inglewood fault. The new shallow structure will greatly impact simulation-based studies of seismic hazard, especially in the near-surface low-velocity zones beneath densely populated areas like the Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Ventura Basins.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inverse problems often involve sampling posterior distributions on infinite-dimensional function spaces. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon mesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more accurate. Such methods are typically forced to reduce step-sizes as the discretization gets finer, and thus are expensive as a function of dimension. Recently, a new class of MCMC methods with mesh-independent convergence times has emerged. However, few of them take into account the geometry of the posterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric MCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated distributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are in general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite dimensions. In this work, we combine geometric methods on a finite-dimensional subspace with mesh-independent infinite-dimensional approaches. Our objective is to speed up MCMC mixing times, without significantly increasing the computational cost per step (for instance, in comparison with the vanilla preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method). This is achieved by using ideas from geometric MCMC to probe the complex structure of an intrinsic finite-dimensional subspace where most data information concentrates, while retaining robust mixing times as the dimension grows by using pCN-like methods in the complementary subspace. The resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the context of three challenging inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, heat conduction and incompressible flow control. The algorithms exhibit up to two orders of magnitude improvement in sampling efficiency when compared with the pCN method.},

However, similarly to algorithms based on random walk or Langevin proposals, the number of steps required to explore the target distribution typically grows with the dimension of the state space. We define a generalized HMC algorithm which overcomes this problem for target measures arising as finite-dimensional approximations of measures {$\pi$} which have density with respect to a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The key idea is to construct an MCMC method which is well defined on the Hilbert space itself.},

  abstract = {The Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) describes the decomposition of a flow field into its divergence-free and curlfree components. Many researchers in various communities like weather modeling, oceanology, geophysics, and computer graphics are interested in understanding the properties of flow representing physical phenomena such as incompressibility and vorticity. The HHD has proven to be an important tool in the analysis of fluids, making it one of the fundamental theorems in fluid dynamics. The recent advances in the area of flow analysis have led to the application of the HHD in a number of research communities such as flow visualization, topological analysis, imaging, and robotics. However, because the initial body of work, primarily in the physics communities, research on the topic has become fragmented with different communities working largely in isolation often repeating and sometimes contradicting each others results. Additionally, different nomenclature has evolved which further obscures the fundamental connections between fields making the transfer of knowledge difficult. This survey attempts to address these problems by collecting a comprehensive list of relevant references and examining them using a common terminology. A particular focus is the discussion of boundary conditions when computing the HHD. The goal is to promote further research in the field by creating a common repository of techniques to compute the HHD as well as a large collection of example applications in a broad range of areas.},

  abstract = {We develop a two-dimensional travel time tomography method, which regularizes the inversion by modeling groups of slowness pixels from discrete slowness maps, called patches, as sparse linear combinations of atoms from a dictionary. We propose to use dictionary learning during the inversion to adapt dictionaries to specific slowness maps. This patch regularization, called the local model, is integrated into the overall slowness map, called the global model. The local model considers small-scale variations using a sparsity constraint, and the global model considers largerscale features constrained using 2 regularization. This strategy in a locally sparse travel time tomography (LST) approach enables simultaneous modeling of smooth and discontinuous slowness features. This is in contrast to conventional tomography methods, which constrain models to be exclusively smooth or discontinuous. We develop a maximum a posteriori formulation for LST and exploit the sparsity of slowness patches using dictionary learning. The LST approach compares favorably with smoothness and total variation regularization methods on densely, but irregularly sampled synthetic slowness maps.},

A few boundaries are newly interpreted from topography, volcanism, and/or seismicity, taking into account relative plate velocities from magnetic anomalies, moment tensor solutions, and/or geodesy. In addition to the 14 large plates whose motion was described by the NUVEL-1A poles (Africa, Antarctica, Arabia, Australia, Caribbean, Cocos, Eurasia, India, Juan de Fuca, Nazca, North America, Pacific, Philippine Sea, South America), model PB2002 includes 38 small plates (Okhotsk, Amur, Yangtze, Okinawa, Sunda, Burma, Molucca Sea, Banda Sea, Timor, Birds Head, Maoke, Caroline, Mariana, North Bismarck, Manus, South Bismarck, Solomon Sea, Woodlark, New Hebrides, Conway Reef, Balmoral Reef, Futuna, Niuafo'ou, Tonga, Kermadec, Rivera, Galapagos, Easter, Juan Fernandez, Panama, North Andes, Altiplano, Shetland, Scotia, Sandwich, Aegean Sea, Anatolia, Somalia), for a total of 52 plates. No attempt is made to divide the Alps-Persia-Tibet mountain belt, the Philippine Islands, the Peruvian Andes, the Sierras Pampeanas, or the California-Nevada zone of dextral transtension into plates; instead, they are designated as "orogens'' in which this plate model is not expected to be accurate. The cumulative-number/area distribution for this model follows a power law for plates with areas between 0.002 and 1 steradian. Departure from this scaling at the small-plate end suggests that future work is very likely to define more very small plates within the orogens. The model is presented in four digital files: a set of plate boundary segments; a set of plate outlines; a set of outlines of the orogens; and a table of characteristics of each digitization step along plate boundaries, including estimated relative velocity vector and classification into one of 7 types (continental convergence zone, continental transform fault, continental rift, oceanic spreading ridge, oceanic transform fault, oceanic convergent boundary, subduction zone). Total length, mean velocity, and total rate of area production/destruction are computed for each class; the global rate of area production and destruction is 0.108 m(2)/s, which is higher than in previous models because of the incorporation of back-arc spreading.},

SED algorithms can be divided into two categories: those that assume a linear or linearized relationship between measured data and parameters, and those that account for a fully nonlinear relationship. We compare the most commonly used linear method, Bayesian D-optimization, to two nonlinear methods, maximum entropy design and DN-optimization, in a synthetic seismological source location problem where we define a region of the subsurface in which earthquake sources are likely to occur. Example random sources in this region are sampled with a uniform distribution and their arrival time data across the ground surface are forward modelled; the goal of SED is to define a surface monitoring network that optimally constrains this set of source locations given the data that would be observed. Receiver networks so designed are evaluated on performance\textemdash the percentage of earthquake pairs whose arrival time differences are above a threshold of measurement uncertainty at each receiver, the number of prior samples (earthquakes) required to evaluate the statistical performance of each design and the SED compute time for different subsurface velocity models. We find that DN-optimization provides the best results both in terms of performance and compute time. Linear design is more computationally expensive and designs poorer performing networks. Maximum entropy design is shown to be effectively impractical due to the large number of samples and long compute times required.},

  abstract = {Azimuthal anisotropy is a powerful tool to reveal information about both the present structure and past evolution of the mantle. Anisotropic images of the upper mantle are usually obtained by analysing various types of seismic observables, such as surface wave dispersion curves or waveforms, SKS splitting data, or receiver functions. These different data types sample different volumes of the earth, they are sensitive to different length scales, and hence are associated with different levels of uncertainties. They are traditionally interpreted separately, and often result in incompatible models. We present a Bayesian inversion approach to jointly invert these different data types. Seismograms for SKS and P phases are directly inverted using a cross-convolution approach, thus avoiding intermediate processing steps, such as numerical deconvolution or computation of splitting parameters. Probabilistic 1-D profiles are obtained with a transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, in which the number of layers, as well as the presence or absence of anisotropy in each layer, are treated as unknown parameters. In this way, seismic anisotropy is only introduced if required by the data. The algorithm is used to resolve both isotropic and anisotropic layering down to a depth of 350 km beneath two seismic stations in North America in two different tectonic settings: the stable Canadian shield (station FFC) and the tectonically active southern Basin and Range Province (station TA-214A). In both cases, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is clearly visible, and marked by a change in direction of the fast axis of anisotropy. Our study confirms that azimuthal anisotropy is a powerful tool for detecting layering in the upper mantle.},

  abstract = {The reversible jump algorithm is a statistical method for Bayesian inference with a variable number of unknowns. Here, we apply this method to the seismic tomography problem. The approach lets us consider the issue of model parametrization (i.e. the way of discretizing the velocity field) as part of the inversion process. The model is parametrized using Voronoi cells with mobile geometry and number. The size, position and shape of the cells defining the velocity model are directly determined by the data. The inverse problem is tackled within a Bayesian framework and explicit regularization of model parameters is not required. The mobile position and number of cells means that global damping procedures, controlled by an optimal regularization parameter, are avoided. Many velocity models with variable numbers of cells are generated via a transdimensional Markov chain and information is extracted from the ensemble as a whole. As an aid to interpretation we visualize the expected earth model that is obtained via Monte Carlo integration in a straightforward manner. The procedure is particularly adept at imaging rapid changes or discontinuities in wave speed. While each velocity model in the final ensemble consists of many discontinuities at cell boundaries, these are smoothed out in the averaged ensemble solution while those required by the data are reinforced. The ensemble of models can also be used to produce uncertainty estimates and experiments with synthetic data suggest that they represent actual uncertainty surprisingly well. We use the fast marching method in order to iteratively update the ray geometry and account for the non-linearity of the problem. The method is tested here with synthetic data in a 2-D application and compared with a subspace method that is a more standard matrix-based inversion scheme. Preliminary results illustrate the advantages of the reversible jump algorithm. A real data example is also shown where a tomographic image of Rayleigh wave group velocity for the Australian continent is constructed together with uncertainty estimates.},

  abstract = {A meaningful interpretation of seismic measurements requires a rigorous quantification of the uncertainty. In an inverse problem, the data noise determines how accurately observations should be fit, and ultimately the level of detail contained in the recovered model. A common problem in seismic tomography is the difficulty in quantifying data uncertainties, and thus the required level of data fit. Traditionally, the complexity of the solution model (defined by both the number of basis functions and the regularization) is defined arbitrarily by the user prior to inversion with only limited use of data errors. In the context of multiscale problems, dealing with multiple data sets that are characterized by different noise variances and that span the Earth at different scales is a major challenge. Practitioners are usually required to arbitrarily weigh the contribution of each data type into the final solution. Furthermore, the basis functions are usually spatially uniform across the velocity field and regularization procedures are global, which prevents the solution model from accounting for the uneven spatial distribution of information. In this work we propose to address these issues with a Hierarchical Bayesian inversion. The new algorithm represents an extension of the transdimensional tomography to account for uncertainties in data noise. This approach has the advantage of treating the level of noise in each data set, as well as the number of model parameters, as unknowns in the inversion. It provides a parsimonious solution that fully represents the degree of knowledge one has about seismic structure (i.e. constraints, resolution and trade-offs). Rather than being forced to make decisions on parametrization, level of data fit and weights between data types in advance, as is often the case in an optimization framework, these choices are relaxed and instead constrained by the data themselves. The new methodology is presented in a synthetic example where both the data density and the underlying structure contain multiple length scales. Three ambient noise data sets that span the Australian continent at different scales are then simultaneously inverted to infer a multiscale tomographic image of Rayleigh wave group velocity for the Australian continent. The procedure turns out to be particularly useful when dealing with multiple data types with different unknown levels of noise as the algorithm is able to naturally adjust the fit to the different data sets and provide a velocity map with a spatial resolution adapted to the spatially variable information present in the data.},

This issue is essential as the use of seismic noise is more and more popular for seismic hazard purposes with a growing number of processing techniques based on the assumption that the noise wavefield is predominantly consisting of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves. This survey reveals an overall agreement about the origin of seismic noise and its frequency dependence. At frequencies higher than 1 Hz, seismic noise systematically exhibits daily and weekly variations linked to human activities, whereas at lower frequencies (between 0.005 and 0.3 Hz) the variation of seismic noise is correlated to natural activities (oceanic, meteorological...). Such a surface origin clearly supports the interpretation of seismic noise wavefield consisting primarily of surface waves. However, the further, very common (though hidden) assumption according which almost all the noise energy would be carried by fundamental mode Rayleigh waves is not supported by the few available data: no "average" number can though be given concerning the actual proportion between surface and body waves, Love and Rayleigh waves (horizontal components), fundamental and higher modes (vertical components), since the few available investigations report a significant variability, which might be related with site conditions and noise source properties.

Seismic interferometry shows that the cross correlation of simultaneous recordings of a random wavefield made at two locations is formally related to the impulse response between those locations. This idea has found many applications in seismology, as a growing number of dense seismic networks become available: cross-correlating long seismic records, the Green's function between instrument pairs is reconstructed and used, just like the seismic recording of an explosion, in tomography, monitoring, etc. These applications have been accompanied by theoretical investigations of the relationship between noise cross correlation and the Green's function; numerous formulations of ambient noise theory have emerged, each based on different hypotheses and/or analytical approaches. The purpose of this study is to present most of those approaches together, providing a comprehensive overview of the theory. Understanding the specific hypotheses behind each Green's function recipe is critical to its correct application. Hoping to guide nonspecialists who approach ambient noise theory for the first time, we treat the simplest formulation (the stationary-phase approximation applied to smooth unbounded media) in detail. We then move on to more general treatments, illustrating that the stationary-phase and reciprocity theorem approaches lead to the same formulae when applied to the same scenario. We show that a formal cross correlation/Green's function relationship can be found in complex, bounded media and for nonuniform source distributions. We finally provide the bases for understanding how the Green's function is reconstructed in the presence of scattering obstacles.},

We present an analysis at the global scale of these different contributions in the context of body-wave retrieval using the cross-correlation technique. Specifically, we compare the correlation of long codas after strong earthquakes with those of the quietest days. In the long period range (25\textendash 100 s), several phases that propagate in the deep Earth are observed in the correlations of the signals recorded after earthquakes, with some of these phases showing nonphysical polarization. At the same time, the global section of correlations shows a series of spurious branches. These features are reproduced with synthetic correlations. A stack of the quietest days of the year shows that body waves are still present, with relative amplitudes that are closer to those expected for the actual Earth response. When considering shorter periods (5\textendash 10 s), the reconstruction of the deep phases is not affected by the earthquake coda, due to the dominance of scattering over reverberation.},

  abstract = {As seismic traveltime tomography continues to be refined using data from the vast USArray data set, it is advantageous to also exploit the amplitude information carried by seismic waves. We use ambient noise cross correlation to make observations of surface wave amplification and attenuation at shorter periods (8\textendash 32 s) than can be observed with only traditional teleseismic earthquake sources. We show that the wavefront tracking approach can be successfully applied to ambient noise correlations, yielding results quite similar to those from earthquake observations at periods of overlap. This consistency indicates that the wavefront tracking approach is viable for use with ambient noise correlations, despite concerns of the inhomogeneous and unknown distribution of noise sources. The resulting amplification and attenuation maps correlate well with known tectonic and crustal structure; at the shortest periods, our amplification and attenuation maps correlate well with surface geology and known sedimentary basins, while our longest period amplitudes are controlled by crustal thickness and begin to probe upper mantle materials. These amplification and attenuation observations are sensitive to crustal materials in different ways than traveltime observations and may be used to better constrain temperature or density variations. We also value them as an independent means of describing the lateral variability of observed Rayleigh wave amplitudes without the need for 3-D tomographic inversions.},

  abstract = {Surface waves from earthquakes are known to cause strong damage, especially for larger structures such as skyscrapers and bridges. However, common practice in characterizing seismic hazard at a specific site considers the effect of near-surface geology on only vertically propagating body waves. Here we show that surface waves have a unique and different frequency-dependent response to known geologic structure and that this amplification can be analytically calculated in a manner similar to current hazard practices. Applying this framework to amplification in the Los Angeles Basin, we find that peak ground accelerations for certain large regional earthquakes are underpredicted if surface waves are not properly accounted for and that the frequency of strongest ground motion amplification can be significantly different. Including surface-wave amplification in hazards calculations is therefore essential for accurate predictions of strong ground motion for future San Andreas Fault ruptures.},

While this information is rarely fully available due to the paucity of relevant seismic data, dense arrays like the 5200-geophone array in Long Beach, California provide the opportunity to study this amplitude variability. Here we show that ambient noise correlation amplitudes from the Long Beach array can be used to directly determine frequency-dependent site amplification factors. We analyze Rayleigh-wavefield amplitude gradients from ambient noise correlations that are processed so that relative amplitudes satisfy the wave equation and are therefore meaningful. Ultimately, we construct maps of site amplification across Long Beach at frequencies of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz. These maps correlate well with local structure, notably the Newport-Inglewood Fault and also to known velocity structure. Through this process, we also obtain constraints on average attenuation structure and local scattering.},

A phase change origin for the interface can explain a triplicated arrival observed in seismic waveform data and is supported by the recent discovery of a post-perovskite phase transition. We investigate the interaction of slabs, plumes, and the phase change within D00 in 2-D compressible convection calculations, and predict waveform complexity in synthetic seismic data. The dynamic models produce significant thermal and phase heterogeneity in D00 over small distances and reveal a variety of behaviors including: (1) distinct pPv blocks separated by upwellings, (2) notches at the top of a pPv layer caused by plume heads, (3) regions of Pv embedded within a pPv layer due to upwellings. Advected isotherms produce complicated thermal structure that enable multiple crossings of the phase boundary. Perturbations to S, SdS, and ScS arrivals (distances {$<$}84 degrees) are linked to the evolutionary stage of slabs and plumes, and can be used to determine phase boundary height and velocity increase, volumetric wavespeed anomaly beneath the discontinuity, and possibly the lengthscale of slab folding near the CMB. Resolving fine-scale structure beneath the interface requires additional seismic phases (e.g., Sd, SKS) and larger distances ({$>$}80 degrees). \'O 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The presence of sediments near the Earth's surface can significantly amplify the strength of shaking during earthquakes. Such basin or site amplification effects have been well documented in numerous regions, yet the complex and often situational dependence of competing reasons for this amplification makes it hard to quantify in a general sense or to determine the most significant contributions. Simple 1D seismic profiles can be used to estimate the amplitude differences between a basin site and a hard-rock reference site, but this ignores any reflections or conversions at the basin edge or a resonance effect depending on the basin's geometry. In this article, we explore an analytic model based on coupling coefficients for surface Rayleigh waves to account for the lateral discontinuities at a basin's edge (Datta 2018). We use this simple tool to explore the relationship between the basin's Rayleigh-wave amplification spectrum and various parameters such as basin depth, edge slope angle, and impedance contrast. The step-by-step construction of the model allows us to quantify the contributions from various wave propagation effects with the goal of identifying situations under which various basin-edge effects must be considered in addition to purely 1D estimates. For the most velocity contrasts (less than a factor of 5), the error made by the 1D theory in predicting maximum Rayleigh-wave basin amplification is under 35\% for both the horizontal and the vertical components. For simple basins, the vertical amplification dominates at larger high frequencies and the horizontal at lower frequencies. Finally, we demonstrate from comparisons with spectral-element wavefield simulations that realistic velocity structures can be reduced to a simpler ``box'' shape for the semi-analytic formulation used here with reasonable results. For the purposes of estimating site-amplification or microzonation, an improved model that accounts for basin-edge effects can be implemented without high-computational cost.},

The proposed V-s as a function of V-p relations fit Vs and Vp borehole logs in Quaternary alluvium and Salinian Granites as well as laboratory measurements over a 7-km/sec-wide range in V-p. The relations derived here are very close to those used to develop a regional 3D velocity model for southern California, based on pre-1970 data, and thus provide support for that model. These data, and these relations, show a rapid increase in V-s as V-p increases to 3.5 km/sec leading to higher shear-wave velocities in young sedimentary deposits than commonly assumed. These relations, appropriate for active continental margins where earthquakes are prone to occur, suggests that amplification of strong ground motions by shallow geologic deposits may not be as large as predicted by some earlier models.},

We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given observational data and their uncertainty, the governing forward problem and its uncertainty, and a prior probability distribution describing uncertainty in the parameter field, find the posterior probability distribution over the parameter field. The prior must be chosen appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the infinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the posterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to convergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And finally, solution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit construction of the covariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to solve the forward problem as many times as there are parameters. Our computational framework builds on the infinite-dimensional formulation proposed by Stuart [Acta Numer., 19 (2010), pp. 451\textendash 559] and incorporates a number of components aimed at ensuring a convergent discretization of the underlying infinite-dimensional inverse problem. The framework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the prior, constructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed component of the posterior covariance operator, and exploring the posterior that together ensure scalability of the entire framework to very high parameter dimensions. We demonstrate this computational framework on the Bayesian solution of an inverse problem in three-dimensional global seismic wave propagation with hundreds of thousands of parameters.},

Yet, despite these discoveries, the highly heterogeneous and incomplete data coverage of the inner core has impeded the development of tomographic models even at the longest wavelengths. Here, we use a probabilistic and transdimensional tomographic approach (TBI) on a newly expanded dataset of P-wave travel-times sensitive to the upper 120 km of the inner core. The TBI approach yields a ensemble of parsimonious models that simultaneously capture both the dominant hemispheric dichotomy and laterally abrupt velocity variations. Analysis of the model ensemble allows us to determine the locations of the hemisphere boundaries and rule out the presence of hemispheric dichotomy in anisotropy. Instead, we robustly map regional variations in anisotropy beneath Africa and the eastern Pacific, and detect variations at high latitudes suggesting that cylindrical anisotropy may not be adequate for describing the uppermost inner core.},

In order to reliably relate these variations to material properties including temperature, composition and volatile content, we must accurately retrieve both the patterns and amplitudes of variations and quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimates of each. For these reasons, we image the mantle beneath North America with P-wave traveltimes from USArray using a novel method for 3-D probabilistic body-wave tomography. The method uses a Transdimensional Hierarchical Bayesian framework with a reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in order to generate an ensemble of possible velocity models. We analyse this ensemble solution to obtain the posterior probability distribution of velocities, thereby yielding error bars and enabling rigorous hypothesis testing. Overall, we determine that the average uncertainty (1{$\sigma$} ) of compressional wave velocity estimates beneath North America is {$\sim$}0.25 per cent dVP/VP, increasing with proximity to complex structure and decreasing with depth. The addition of USArray data reduces the uncertainty beneath the Eastern US by over 50 per cent in the upper mantle and 25\textendash 40 per cent below the transition zone and {$\sim$}30 per cent throughout the mantle beneath the Western US. In the absence of damping and smoothing, we recover amplitudes of variations 10\textendash 80 per cent higher than a standard inversion approach. Accounting for differences in data coverage, we infer that the length scale of heterogeneity is {$\sim$}50 per cent longer at shallow depths beneath the continental platform than beneath tectonically active regions. We illustrate the model trade-off analysis for the Cascadia slab and the New Madrid Seismic Zone, where we find that smearing due to the limitations of the illumination is relatively minor.},

We assume a water-ice shell, a pyrolitic or a chondritic mantle, and a core composed of pure iron or iron plus 20 weight percent of sulfur. We consider two extreme mantle thermal states: hot and cold. Given a temperature and composition, we determine density, seismic velocities, and attenuation using thermodynamical models. While anelastic effects will be negligible in a cold mantle and the brittle part of the ice shell, strong dispersion and dissipation are expected in a hot convective mantle and the bulk of the ice shell. There is a strong relationship between different thermal structures and compositions. The "hot" mantle may maintain temperatures consistent with a liquid core made of iron plus light elements. For the "cold scenarios," the possibility of a solid iron core cannot be excluded, and it may even be favored. The depths of the ocean and core-mantle boundary are determined with high precision, 10 km and 40 km, respectively, once we assume a composition and thermal structure. Furthermore, the depth of the ocean is relatively insensitive (4 km) to the core composition used.},

The first digital transformation is based on unequally-spaced fast Fourier transforms (USFFT) while the second is based on the wrapping of specially selected Fourier samples. The two implementations essentially differ by the choice of spatial grid used to translate curvelets at each scale and angle. Both digital transformations return a table of digital curvelet coefficients indexed by a scale parameter, an orientation parameter, and a spatial location parameter. And both implementations are fast in the sense that they run in O(n2 log n) flops for n by n Cartesian arrays; in addition, they are also invertible, with rapid inversion algorithms of about the same complexity.},

  abstract = {When considering numerical acoustic or elastic wave propagation in media containing small heterogeneities with respect to the minimum wavelength of the wavefield, being able to upscale physical properties (or homogenize them) is valuable mainly for two reasons. First, replacing the original discontinuous and very heterogeneous medium by a smooth and more simple one, is a judicious alternative to the necessary fine and difficult meshing of the original medium required by many wave equation solvers. Second, it helps to understand what properties of a medium are really `seen' by the wavefield propagating through, which is an important aspect in an inverse problem approach. This paper is an attempt of a pedagogical introduction to nonperiodic homogenization in 1-D, allowing to find the effective wave equation and effective physical properties, of the elastodynamics equation in a highly heterogeneous medium. It can be extrapolated from 1-D to a higher space dimensions. This development can be seen as an extension of the classical two-scale homogenization theory applied to the elastic wave equation in periodic media, with this limitation that it does not hold beyond order 1 in the asymptotic expansion involved in the classical theory.},

This paper is focused on P\textendash SV wave propagation in 2-D, but the methodology can be extended without any theoretical difficulty to the general 3-D case. No assumption on the heterogeneity spectrum is made and the medium can show rapid variations of its elastic properties in all spatial directions. The method used is based on the two-scale homogenization expansion, but extended to the non-periodic case. The scale separation is made using a spatial low-pass filter. The ratio of the filter wavelength cut-off and the minimum wavelength of the propagating wavefield defines a parameter {$\epsilon$}0 with which the wavefield propagating in the homogenized medium converges to the reference wavefield. In the general case, this nonperiodic extension of the homogenization technique is only valid up to the leading order and for the so-called first-order corrector. We apply this non-periodic homogenization procedure to two kinds of heterogeneous media: a randomly generated, highly heterogeneous medium and the Marmousi2 geological model. The method is tested with the Spectral Element Method as a solver to the wave equation. Comparing computations in the homogenized media with those obtained in the original ones shows that convergence with {$\epsilon$}0 is even better than expected. The effects of the leading order correction to the source and first correction at the receivers' location are shown.},

In this paper, we present an introduction to the two-scale non-periodic homogenization method, which is designed to deal with small scales, both for the forward and the inverse problems. It is based on the classical two-scale periodic homogenization, which requires a periodic or a stochastic media, but has been extended to geological media, which are deterministic and multi-scale with no scale separation. The method is based on the minimum wavelength of the wavefield to separate the scales. It makes it possible to compute an effective medium, valid up to a given maximum source frequency, from a given fine-scale description of a medium. The effective medium is in general fully anisotropic and smooth but not constant. It can be tuned so that the wavefield computed in the effective medium is the same as the true solution up to the desired accuracy for all waves, including reflected, refracted or surface waves. For inverse problems, we will numerically check that a limited frequency band full waveform inversion can retrieve, at best, only the homogenized medium and not the true fine-scale one. We will first present the subject through a numerical experiment in 1-D. Then, we will present the method in 1-D and next in 2-D/3-D. Finally, we will present a series of examples in 2-D and 3-D in the forward modeling and inverse problem contexts.},

However, because of the nature of the ambient noise field, the retrieval of body waves from seismic noise recordings is highly challenging and has only been successful in a few cases. Here, we use seismic noise data from a 5,200-node oil-company survey to reconstruct body waves and determine the velocity structure beneath Long Beach, California. To isolate the body wave energy from the ambient noise field, we divide the entire survey into small-aperture subarrays and apply a modified double-beamforming scheme to enhance coherent arrivals within the cross-correlated waveforms. The resulting beamed traces allow us to identify clear refracted P waves traveling between different subarray pairs, which we then use to construct a high-resolution 3D velocity model of the region. The inverted velocity model reveals velocity variations of the order of 3\% and strong lateral discontinuities caused by the presence of sharp geologic structures such as the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF). Additionally, we show that the resolution that is achieved through the use of high-frequency body waves allows us to illuminate small geometric variations of the NIF that were previously unresolved with traditional passive imaging methods.},

(2013) showed that ambient noise surface wave correlations from a high-density oil-company survey could be used to produce a detailed 3D shear-wave velocity model for the top 800 m of Long Beach, CA. In this study, we extend their analysis and use the P-wave portion of the Green's function to generate multiple refraction profiles within Long Beach and determine the velocity structure to a depth of about 3 km. To overcome the inherent challenge of extracting body waves from ambient noise, we divide the Long Beach network into small-aperture subarrays and apply a double beamforming technique between all group of stations to isolate P waves from surface waves. The resulting beamed traces allow us to identify prominent direct and weak scattered arrivals traveling between all subarray pairs. To produce the final velocity profiles, we use a stacked seismic section to derive an initial 1D model and the adjoint-state method to construct the gradients of the misfit functional without the necessity of calculating and saving sensitivities (Fr\'echet derivatives). The inverted velocity profiles show velocity variations of the order of 0.3 km/s and strong lateral discontinuities caused by the presence of sharp structures such as the Newport Inglewood Fault. These profiles also provide us with a set of static corrections that will be applied to a follow on reflection analysis, which will in turn allow us to generate an even more detailed image of the subsurface.},

By incorporating certain hierarchical approaches we show that we can break away from the induced subspace property.

We demonstrate how both geometric ideas and hierarchical ideas can be used to design effective parameterizations for a number of applied inverse problems arising in electrical impedance tomography, groundwater flow and source inversion. In particular we show how geometric ideas, including the level set method, can be used to reconstruct piecewise continuous fields, and we show how hierarchical methods can be used to learn key parameters in continuous fields, such as length-scales, resulting in improved reconstructions. Geometric and hierarchical ideas are combined in the level set method to find piecewise constant reconstructions with interfaces of unknown topology.},

As well as introducing this modified ensemble Kalman inversion methodology, we also study its continuous-time limit, proving ensemble collapse; in the language of multi-agent optimization this may be viewed as reaching consensus.

  abstract = {The methodology developed in this article is motivated by a wide range of prediction and uncertainty quantification problems that arise in Statistics, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics, such as non-parametric regression, multi-class classification and inversion of partial differential equations. One popular formulation of such problems is as Bayesian inverse problems, where a prior distribution is used to regularize inference on a high-dimensional latent state, typically a function or a field. It is common that such priors are non-Gaussian, for example piecewise-constant or heavy-tailed, and/or hierarchical, in the sense of involving a further set of low-dimensional parameters, which, for example, control the scale or smoothness of the latent state. In this formulation prediction and uncertainty quantification relies on efficient exploration of the posterior distribution of latent states and parameters. This article introduces a framework for efficient MCMC sampling in Bayesian inverse problems that capitalizes upon two fundamental ideas in MCMC, non-centred parameterisations of hierarchical models and dimension-robust samplers for latent Gaussian processes. Using a range of diverse applications we showcase that the proposed framework is dimension-robust, that is, the efficiency of the MCMC sampling does not deteriorate as the dimension of the latent state gets higher. We showcase the full potential of the machinery we develop in the article in semi-supervised multi-class classification, where our sampling algorithm is used within an active learning framework to guide the selection of input data to manually label in order to achieve high predictive accuracy with a minimal number of labelled data.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the computational issues of full 3-D tomography, in which the starting model as well as the model perturbation is 3-D and the sensitivity (Fre\textasciiacute chet) kernels are calculated using the full physics of 3-D wave propagation. We compare two formulations of the structural inverse problem: the adjoint-wavefield (AW) method, which back-propagates the data from the receivers to image structure, and the scattering-integral (SI) method, which sets up the inverse problem by calculating and storing the Fre\textasciiacute chet kernels for each data functional. The two inverse methods are closely related, but which one is more efficient depends on the overall problem geometry, particularly on the ratio of sources to receivers, as well as trade-offs in computational resources, such as the relative costs of compute cycles to data storage. We find that the SI method is computationally more efficient than the AW method in regional waveform tomography using large sets of natural sources, although it requires more storage.},

  abstract = {Basin resonances can significantly amplify and prolong ground shaking, and accurate site-amplification estimates are crucial for mitigating potential seismic hazards within metropolitan basins. In this work, we estimate the site amplification of long-period (2\textendash 10 s) ground motions across northeast China for both surface waves and vertically incident shear waves. The spatial distribution of relatively large site amplifications correlates strongly with known sedimentary basins for both wave types. However, the site response of surface waves is typically twice as high as that of shear waves at most basin sites. We further show that these site-amplification features can be well explained by predictions based on the local onedimensional structure at each site. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for surface-wave contributions and demonstrate the usefulness of semi-analytical theory for surface-wave amplification, which may be broadly applicable in future seismic hazard analysis. Plain Language Summary Surface waves are often the dominant wave type observed for large shallow earthquakes at relatively large distances. Surface-wave amplification at sites underlain by thick, soft sediments within the Songliao basin is substantially larger than in adjacent generic rock sites in northeast China. This highlights the importance of accounting for the contributions of surface waves in accurately predicting earthquake ground motions. A semi-analytic method for estimating surface-wave amplification can well explain the most significant site-amplification features, based on the local one-dimensional structure at each site. This approach may be broadly applicable in future seismic hazard analysis.},

  abstract = {Stochastic approaches for inverting geophysical data have many advantages over deterministic inversion methods in terms of finding global solutions and quantifying their associated uncertainty. Since stochastic methods often need to run forward models more times than deterministic algorithms, their applications currently are limited to 1D inverse problems, where forward models can be run very fast. However, due to the rapid growth in computing power, especially parallel computing techniques, and the recent development of new numerical simulation methods, stochastic inversion of 2D geophysical data has become feasible. In this study, we explore the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo based Bayesian models for inverting 2D magnetotelluric (MT) data. To minimize the number of parameters, we adopt sharp boundary parameterization, in which we consider the locations and the resistivity of regions formed by the interfaces as unknowns. We use a parallel, adaptive finite-element algorithm to forward simulate frequency-domain MT responses of 2D conductivity structure. Synthetic case studies show the developed stochastic model is effective for estimating the interface locations and resistivity; most importantly, it provides detailed uncertainty information on each unknown parameter.},

The simplest point process is the (homogeneous) Poisson process, which has an intensity function of a constant value {$\lambda$}. It can be simulated by the sum of its interarrival times. By allowing the intensity to vary, taking values given by a deterministic function {$\lambda$}(t), we can extend the Poisson process to the inhomogeneous case. As proposed by (Lewis and Shedler, 1979), inhomogeneous Poisson processes can be simulated by ``thinning'' the points from the homogeneous versions. Further by allowing the intensity at time t to depend on all information prior to t, we get the self-exciting processes such as the Hawkes processes. The simulation of such processes can also be performed by thinning, as given by (Ogata, 1981).},

Fourth, model averaging approaches are reviewed in which estimators from different models are weighted to provide one final estimator.

The relatively new insight that mixed-mode fracture in local stress equilibrium, rather than downstream advection alone, can introduce nontrivial curvature to crevasse geometry may merit the reinterpretation of some key historical observation studies. In the past three decades, there have been tremendous advances in the spatial resolution of satellite imagery, as well as fully automated algorithms capable of tracking crevasse displacements between repeat images. Despite considerable advances in developing fully transient three-dimensional ice flow models over the past two decades, both the zero stress and linear elastic fracture mechanics crevasse models have remained fundamentally unchanged over this time. In the past decade, however, multidimensional and transient formulations of the continuum damage mechanics approach to simulating ice fracture have emerged. The combination of employing damage mechanics to represent slow upstream deterioration of ice strength and fracture mechanics to represent rapid failure at downstream termini holds promise for implementation in large-scale ice sheet models. Finally, given the broad interest in the sea level rise implications of recent and future cryospheric change, we provide a synthesis of 10 mechanisms by which crevasses can influence glacier mass balance.},

Recent studies have produced topography models with mutual agreement up to degree 2. Abroad-band waveform inversion strategy is introduced and applied here, with relatively low computational cost and based on a first-order Born approximation. Its performance is validated using synthetic waveforms calculated in theoretical earth models that include different topography patterns with varying lateral wavelengths, from 600 to 2500 km, and magnitudes (similar to 10 km peak-to-peak). The source-receiver geometry focuses mainly on the P-diff, PKP, PcP and ScS phases. The results show that PKP branches, PcP and ScS generally perform well and in a similar fashion, while P-diff yields unsatisfactory results. We investigate also how 3-D mantle correction influences the output models, and find that despite the disturbance introduced, the models recovered do not appear to be biased, provided that the 3-D model is correct. Using cross-correlated traveltimes, we derive new topography models from both P and S waves. The static corrections used to remove the mantle effect are likely to affect the inversion, compromising the agreement between models derived from P and S data. By modelling traveltime residuals starting from sensitivity kernels, we show how the simultaneous use of volumetric and boundary kernels can reduce the bias coming from mantle structures. The joint inversion approach should be the only reliable method to invert for CMB topography using absolute cross-correlation traveltimes.},

We run 3-D wave-propagation simulations accurate at periods of 10 s and longer, with Earth models including coremantle boundary topography anomalies of 1000 km spatial wavelength and up to 10 km height. We obtain very different waveform signatures for PcP (reflected) and Pdiff (diffracted) phases, supporting the theoretical expectation that the latter are sensitive primarily to large-scale structure, whereas the former only to small scale, where large and small are relative to the frequency. PcP at 10 s seems to be well suited to map such a small-scale perturbation, whereas Pdiff at the same frequency carries faint signatures that do not allow any tomographic reconstruction. Only at higher frequency, the signature becomes stronger. We present a new algorithm to compute sensitivity kernels relating seismic traveltimes (measured by cross-correlation of observed and theoretical seismograms) to the topography of seismic discontinuities at any depth in the Earth using full 3-D wave propagation. Calculation of accurate finite-frequency sensitivity kernels is notoriously expensive, but we reduce computational costs drastically by limiting ourselves to spherically symmetric reference models, and exploiting the axial symmetry of the resulting propagating wavefield that collapses to a 2-D numerical domain. We compute and analyse a suite of kernels for upper and lower mantle discontinuities that can be used for finite-frequency waveform inversion. The PcP and Pdiff sensitivity footprints are in good agreement with the result obtained cross-correlating perturbed and unperturbed seismogram, validating our approach against full 3-D modelling to invert for such structures.},

This age confirms a previous estimate of 575 {$\pm$} 25 Ma for timing of continental breakup, as derived from the analysis of tectonic subsidence in lower Paleozoic miogeoclinal strata of the North American Cordillera. It also corresponds to the timing of passive margin deposition in the ``underlying'' Windermere Supergroup of the northern Cordillera, as determined by chemostratigraphic correlations. These timing relationships imply a different breakup history for the northern, as compared to the southern, Cordillera. We propose a model that attempts to explain this paradox of Cordilleran geology. The earlier Neoproterozoic (Windermere-age) rifting event probably records breakup of a continental mass from northern Laurentia followed by development of a passive margin. Accordingly, the Windermere Supergroup of the southern Canadian Cordillera was deposited in an intracontinental rift. The second Neoproterozoic rifting (Hamill\textendash Gog) is interpreted to indicate continental breakup and establishment of a passive margin along western Laurentia.},

  abstract = {Large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs), whose origin and dynamic implication remain enigmatic, dominate the lowermost mantle. For decades, seismologists have created increasingly detailed pictures of the LLSVPs through tomographic models constructed with different modeling methodologies, data sets, parametrizations and regularizations. Here, we extend the cluster analysis methodology of Lekic et al., to classify seismic mantle structure in five recent global shear wave speed (V-S) tomographic models into three groups. By restricting the analysis to moving depth windows of the radial profiles of V-S, we assess the vertical extent of features. We also show that three clusters are better than two (or four) when representing the entire lower mantle, as the boundaries of the three clusters more closely follow regions of high lateral V-S gradients. Qualitatively, we relate the anomalously slow cluster to the LLSVPs, the anomalously fast cluster to slab material entering the lower mantle and the neutral cluster to 'background' lower mantle material. We obtain compatible results by repeating the analysis on recent global P-wave speed (V-P) models, although we find less agreement across V-P models. We systematically show that the clustering results, even in detail, agree remarkably well with a wide range of local waveform studies. This suggests that the two LLSVPs consist of multiple internal anomalies with a wide variety of morphologies, including shallowly to steeply sloping, and even overhanging, boundaries. Additionally, there are indications of previously unrecognized meso-scale features, which, like the Perm anomaly, are separated from the two main LLSVPs beneath the Pacific and Africa. The observed wide variety of structure size and morphology offers a challenge to recreate in geodynamic models; potentially, the variety can result from various degrees of mixing of several compositionally distinct components. Finally, we obtain new, much larger estimates of the volume/mass occupied by LLSVPs-8.0 per cent +/- 0.9 (mu +/- 1 sigma) of whole mantle volume and 9.1 per cent +/- 1.0 (mu +/- 1 sigma) of whole mantle mass-and discuss implications for associating the LLSVPs with the hidden reservoir enriched in heat producing elements.},

Here, we present a new sampling technique that can be used to efficiently compute white noise samples in a finite element method (FEM) and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) setting. The key idea is to exploit the finite element matrix assembly procedure and factorize each local mass matrix independently, hence avoiding the factorization of a large matrix. Moreover, in an MLMC framework, the white noise samples must be coupled between subsequent levels. We show how our technique can be used to enforce this coupling even in the case of nonnested mesh hierarchies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with numerical experiments. We observe optimal convergence rates for the finite element solution of the elliptic SPDEs of interest in 2D and 3D and we show convergence of the sampled field covariances. In an MLMC setting, a good coupling is enforced and the telescoping sum is respected.},

Destructive interference among adjacent frequencies in the broad-band pulse renders a cross-correlation traveltime measurement sensitive only to the wave speed in a hollow banana-shaped region surrounding the unperturbed geometrical ray. The Frechet kernel expressing this sensitivity is expressed as a double sum over all forward-propagating body waves from the source and backward-propagating body waves from the receiver to every single scatterer in the vicinity of this central ray. The kernel for a differential traveltime, measured by cross-correlation of two phases at the same receiver, is simply the difference of the respective single-phase kernels. In the paraxial approximation, an absolute or differential traveltime kernel can be computed extremely economically by implementing a single kinematic and dynamic ray trace along each source-to-receiver ray.},

In many situations, exact sampling from a given distribution is impossible or computationally expensive and, therefore, one needs to resort to approximate sampling strategies. However, there is no well-developed theory providing meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees for the approximate sampling procedures, especially in high dimensional problems. The paper makes some progress in this direction by considering the problem of sampling from a distribution having a smooth and log-concave density defined on Rp, for some integer p {$>$} 0. We establish non-asymptotic bounds for the error of approximating the target distribution by the distribution obtained by the Langevin Monte Carlo method and its variants. We illustrate the effectiveness of the established guarantees with various experiments. Underlying our analysis are insights from the theory of continuous time diffusion processes, which may be of interest beyond the framework of log-concave densities that are considered in the present work.},

Patterns in rupture complexity arise from a scaling between subevent moment and main event moment. These results can be explained by simple 2-D dynamic rupture simulations with self-affine heterogeneity in fault prestress. Applying this to early magnitude estimates, we show that the main event magnitude can be estimated after observing only the first few subevents.},

The use of elliptic PDE operators to construct covariance operators allows to build on fast PDE solvers for manipulations with the resulting covariance and precision operators. However, PDE operators require a choice of boundary conditions, and this choice can have a strong and usually undesired influence on the Gaussian random field. We propose two techniques that allow to ameliorate these boundary effects for large-scale problems. The first approach combines the elliptic PDE operator with a Robin boundary condition, where a varying Robin coefficient is computed from an optimization problem. The second approach normalizes the pointwise variance by rescaling the covariance operator. These approaches can be used individually or can be combined. We study properties of these approaches, and discuss their computational complexity. The performance of our approaches is studied for random fields defined over simple and complex two- and three-dimensional domains.},

  abstract = {These lecture notes highlight the mathematical and computational structure relating to the formulation of, and development of algorithms for, the Bayesian approach to inverse problems in differential equations. This approach is fundamental in the quantification of uncertainty within applications involving the blending of mathematical models with data. The finite dimensional situation is described first, along with some motivational examples. Then the development of probability measures on separable Banach space is undertaken, using a random series over an infinite set of functions to construct draws; these probability measures are used as priors in the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. Regularity of draws from the priors is studied in the natural Sobolev or Besov spaces implied by the choice of functions in the random series construction, and the Kolmogorov continuity theorem is used to extend regularity considerations to the space of H\textasciidieresis older continuous functions. Bayes' theorem is derived in this prior setting, and here interpreted as finding conditions under which the posterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior, and determining a formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative in terms of the likelihood of the data. Having established the form of the posterior, we then describe various properties common to it in the infinite dimensional setting. These properties include well-posedness, approximation theory, and the existence of maximum a posteriori estimators. We then describe measure-preserving dynamics, again on the infinite dimensional space, including Markov chain-Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods, and measure-preserving reversible stochastic differential equations. By formulating the theory and algorithms on the underlying infinite dimensional space, we obtain a framework suitable for rigorous analysis of the accuracy of reconstructions, of computational complexity, as well as naturally constructing algorithms which perform well under mesh refinement, since they are inherently well-defined in infinite dimensions.},

Consequently, there is an exponential growth in the size of data volumes and prohibitive demands on computational resources. We have developed a method to compress and process seismic data directly in a low-rank tensor format, which drastically reduces the amount of storage required to represent the data. Seismic data exhibit a low-rank structure in a particular transform domain, which can be exploited to compress the dense data in one extremely storage-efficient tensor format when the data are fully sampled or can be interpolated when the data have missing entries. In either case, once our data are represented in the compressed tensor form, we have developed an algorithm to extract source or receiver gathers directly from the compressed parameters. This extraction process can be done on the fly directly on the compressed data, and it does not require scanning through the entire data set to form shot gathers. We apply this shot-extraction technique in the context of stochastic full-waveform inversion as well as forming full subsurface image gathers through probing techniques and reveal the minor differences between using the full and compressed data, while drastically reducing the total memory costs.},

  abstract = {Two large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the deep mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific are generally interpreted as hot but chemically dense `piles', which have remained isolated from mantle circulation for several hundred million years. This interpretation largely hinges on four seismic observations: (i) their shear wave velocity anomalies are considered too large for purely thermal structures; (ii) shear wave velocity gradients at their edges are sharp; (iii) their shear to compressional wave-speed anomaly ratios are high; and (iv) their shear and bulk-sound velocity anomalies appear to be anti-correlated. However, using compressible global mantle circulation models driven by 300 Myr of plate motion history and thermodynamic methods for converting from physical to seismic structure, we show that observed lower mantle shear wave velocity anomalies do not require, and are most likely incompatible with, large-scale chemical `piles'. A prescribed core-mantle-boundary temperature of 4000 K, which is consistent with current estimates, combined with anelastic seismic sensitivity to temperature, ensures that purely thermal LLSVPs, strongly focussed beneath Africa and the Pacific by subduction history, can reconcile observed shear wave velocity anomalies and gradients. By contrast, shear wave velocity anomalies from models that include dense chemical `piles' at the base of Earth's mantle, where `piles' correspond to only 3\% of the mantle's volume, are substantially stronger than the tomographic model S40RTS, even after accounting for limited tomographic resolution. Our results also suggest that in the presence of post-perovskite, elevated ratios between shear and compressional wavespeed anomalies and the correlation between shear and bulk-sound velocity anomalies cannot be used to discriminate between thermal and compositional heterogeneity at depth: in all calculations, an anticorrelation only occurs within the post-perovskite stability field. Taken together, this implies that although there must be considerable chemical heterogeneity within Earth's mantle, large, coherent `piles' are not required to reconcile the seismic observations examined here. Indeed, our results suggest that if chemical heterogeneity is present in these regions, its dynamical and seismic significance is far less than has previously been inferred.},

This phase field approach is justified by proving G- convergence to the functional with perimeter regularization as   0. The computational approach is based on a finite element approximation. This discretization is shown to converge in an appropriate way to the solution of the phase field problem. We derive an iterative method which is shown to yield an energy decreasing sequence converging to a discrete critical point. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated with numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {We present a practical grid-based method in 3-D spherical coordinates for computing multiple phases comprising any number of reflection and transmission branches in heterogeneous layered media. The new scheme is based on a multistage approach which treats each layer that the wave front enters as a separate computational domain. A finite-difference eikonal solver known as the fast-marching method (FMM) is reinitialized at each interface to track the evolving wave front as either a reflection back into the incident layer or a transmission through to the adjacent layer. Unlike the standard FMM, which only finds first arrivals, this multistage approach can track those later arriving phases explicitly caused by the presence of discontinuities. Notably, the method does not require an irregular mesh to be constructed in order to connect interface nodes to neighbouring velocity nodes which lie on a regular grid. To improve accuracy, local grid refinement is used in the neighbourhood of a source point where wave front curvature is high. The method also provides a way to trace reflections from an interface that are not the first arrival (e.g. the global PP phase). These are computed by initializing the multistage FMM from both the source and receiver, propagating the two wave fronts to the reflecting interface, and finding stationary points of the sum of the two traveltime fields on the reflecting interface. A series of examples are presented to test the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of the new scheme. As well as efficiently computing various global phases to an acceptable accuracy through the ak135 model, we also demonstrate the ability of the scheme to track complex crustal phases that may be encountered in coincident reflection, wide-angle reflection/refraction or local earthquake surveys. In one example, a variety of phases are computed in the presence of a realistic subduction zone, which includes several layer pinch-outs and a subducting slab. Our numerical tests show that the new scheme is a practical and robust alternative to conventional ray tracing for finding various phases in layered media at a variety of scales.},

  abstract = {The seismic structure of the Martian interior can shed light on the formation and dynamic evolution of the planet and our solar system. The deployment of the seismograph carried by the InSight mission provides a means to study Martian internal structure. We used ambient noise autocorrelation to analyze the available vertical component seismic data to recover the reflectivity beneath the Insight lander. We identify the noise that is approximately periodic with the Martian sol as daily lander operations and the diurnal variation in Martian weather and tides. To investigate the seismic discontinuities at different depths, the autocorrelograms are filtered and stacked into different frequency bands. We observe prominent reflection signals probably corresponding to the Martian Moho, the olivine-wadsleyite transition in the mantle, and the core-mantle boundary in the stacked autocorrelograms. We estimate the depths of these boundaries as \textasciitilde 35, 1,110\textendash 1,170, and 1,520\textendash 1,600 km, consistent with other estimates. Plain Language Summary Knowledge of the Martian interior informs theories for the formation and dynamic evolution of another terrestrial planet, hence providing information on the history of the solar system. On Earth, subsurface structure is discovered by analysis of seismic signals recorded by large seismograph arrays deployed worldwide. The InSight lander carried one seismic station to Mars at the end of 2018, providing the opportunity to investigate the internal structure of Mars. Here we autocorrelated ambient noise from the available seismic data to investigate the subsurface discontinuities of Mars. In the raw seismic data, we observe the long-period signals with a period of \textasciitilde 1 Martian sol (\textasciitilde 3\% longer than an Earth day), which are related to the diurnal variation in weather and tides. After the removal of instrument response, remaining high-amplitude peaks are likely caused by the daily operations of the InSight lander. We preprocessed the raw data and used different frequency bands to detect discontinuities at different depths. We identify prominent signals in the stacked autocorrelation reflectivity as likely originating from the Martian Moho, the olivine-wadsleyite transition in the Martian mantle, and the core-mantle boundary. These results are consistent with other observations and measurements.},

In a layered medium, we can describe the surface-wave behavior with harmonic time dependence in terms of an eigenproblem where the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions define the surface-wave modes. Numerous studies have explored diverse numerical approaches to solve this eigenproblem, but they tend to suffer from numerical difficulties that limit the complexity of the medium, frequency range of applicability, or accuracy of the solution. We propose an equivalent formulation that replaces the conventional stress-displacement vector with an alternative one, in order to cast the eigenproblem in a standard form that is linear in the eigenvalues. We discretize the system and boundary conditions using a Chebyshev spectral collocation method, leading to a finite-dimensional generalized matrix eigenvalue problem that can be solved directly. No iterations are required to satisfy the boundary conditions or to isolate the eigenmodes. Collocation methods allow for the solution of the eigenproblem for general depth-dependent elastic properties, including continuous depth variations of the properties as well as material interfaces. We illustrate the use of our technique to calculate dispersion curves, theoretical waveform time series, and to estimate the change from retrograde to prograde particle motion at the surface for a complex 1D structure under Los Angeles.},

Full wave field inversion exploits the constraints on the gradients of the wave field that array data inherently possess. We pose full wave field inversion as a partial differential equation (PDE) constrained inverse problem resulting in a joint estimation of a reconstructed wave field and the medium parameters. The inverse problem is solved by variable projection. We explicitly allow for non-unique solutions to the PDE system that is imposed as a constraint. The boundary conditions of the wave field do not need to be specified, and can remain unknown. This makes the algorithm suitable for inverting observations of ambient seismic noise by dense arrays. The result is that the inverse problem for subsurface properties becomes insensitive to the character and distribution of the noise sources that excited the seismic wave field. In principle the formulation holds equally for ambient noise wave fields and for wave fields excited by controlled sources. The theory is supported with examples in one dimension in the time domain, and in two dimensions in the frequency domain. The latter are of interest in the inversion of surface wave ambient noise for phase velocity maps.},

  abstract = {Mantle flow induces dynamic topography at the core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB), with distribution and amplitude that depend on details of the flow. To assess whether observations of CMB topography can give constraints on deep mantle structure, we determine CMB dynamic topography associated with different models of mantle convection, including thermochemical and purely thermal models. We investigate the influence of key controlling parameters, specifically the thermal viscosity ratio ( {$\eta$}T) and, for thermochemical models, the density contrast ( {$\rho$}C) and viscosity ratio ( {$\eta$}C) between primordial and regular materials. In purely thermal models, plume clusters induce positive topography with an amplitude that decreases with increasing {$\eta$}T. In thermochemical models with moderate density contrasts, around 100\textendash 200 kg m-3, reservoirs of dense material induce depressions in CMB topography, surrounded by a ridge of positive topography. The average depression depth and ridge height increase with increasing {$\rho$}C and {$\eta$}C, but decrease with increasing {$\eta$}T. We find that for purely thermal models or thermochemical models with {$\rho$}C {$\sim$} 90 kg m-3 and less, the long-wavelength (spherical harmonic degrees up to l = 4) dynamic topography and shear wave velocity anomalies predicted by thermochemical distributions anticorrelate. By contrast, for models with {$\rho$}C {$\geq$} 100 kg m-3 and {$\eta$}C {$>$} 1, long-wavelength dynamic topography and shear wave velocity anomalies correlate well. This potentially provides a test to infer the nature, that is, either purely or mostly thermal ( {$\rho$}C {$\leq$} 100 kg m-3 m-3) or strongly thermochemical ( {$\rho$}C {$\geq$} 100 kg m-3), of the low shear wave velocity provinces observed by global tomographic images. The presence of post-perovskite, provided that its viscosity is similar to that of bridgmanite, does not alter these conclusions.},

The algorithm applies advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in combination with sequential techniques (particle filters) to carry out geoacoustic inversions for consecutive data sets acquired along a track. Changes in model parametrization along the track (e.g., number of sediment layers) are accounted for with trans-dimensional partition modeling, which intrinsically determines the amount of structure supported by the data information content. Challenging issues of rapid environmental change between consecutive data sets and high information content (peaked likelihood) are addressed by bridging distributions implemented using annealed importance sampling. This provides an efficient method to locate high-likelihood regions for new data which are distant and / or disjoint from previous high-likelihood regions. The algorithm is applied to simulated reflection-coefficient data along a track, such as can be collected using a towed array close to the seabed. The simulated environment varies rapidly along the track, with changes in the number of layers, layer thicknesses, and geoacoustic parameters within layers. In addition, the seabed contains a geologic fault, where all layers are offset abruptly, and an erosional channel. Changes in noise level are also considered.},

We show that model choice is fundamentally linked to uncertainty estimation and can have profound effects on results. The approach developed here is based on a trans-dimensional selfparametrization of the fault, avoids regularization constraints and provides rigorous uncertainty estimation that accounts for model-selection ambiguity associated with the fault discretization. In particular, the fault is parametrized using self-adapting irregular grids which intrinsically match the local resolving power of the data and provide parsimonious solutions requiring few parameters to capture complex rupture characteristics. Rupture causality is ensured by parametrizing rupture-onset time by a rupture-velocity field and obtaining first rupture times from the eikonal equation. The Bayesian sampling of the parameter space is implemented on a computer cluster with a highly efficient parallel tempering algorithm.},

The existence of hemispherical variations used to be controversial, but there is now strong evidence from both seismic body wave and normal mode observations, showing stronger anisotropy, less attenuation, and a lower isotropic velocity in the western hemisphere. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hemispherical pattern: either (a) inner core translation, wherein one hemisphere is melting and the other is solidifying, or (b) thermochemical convection in the outer core, leading to different solidification conditions at the inner core boundary. Neither is (yet) able to explain all seismically observed features, and a combination of different mechanisms is probably required.},

To illustrate and test the model some characteristicsof seismicity following a stressstep have been explored.It is proposedthat variousfeatures of earthquake clusteringarise from sensitivity of nucleation times to the stresschangesinduced by prior earthquakes.The model givesthe characteristicOmori aftershockdecay law and interprets aftershockparameters in terms of stresschangeand stressingrate.

These quantities are of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystro\textasciidieresis m-based low-rank matrix approximation as well as in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; moreover, they are of interest since they define the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary n \texttimes{} d matrix A, with n {$\gg$} d, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to all n of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of n and d) in O(nd log n) time, as opposed to the O(nd2) time required by the na\textasciidieresis\i ve algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the range of A. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an underconstrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with n {$\approx$} d, and the extension to streaming environments.},

Recently it has been employed in the context of Bayesian inversion, allowing for the quantification of uncertainty within the reconstruction of interfaces. However, the Bayesian approach is very sensitive to the length and amplitude scales in the prior probabilistic model. This paper demonstrates how the scale-sensitivity can be circumvented by means of a hierarchical approach, using a single scalar parameter. Together with careful consideration of the development of algorithms which encode probability measure equivalences as the hierarchical parameter is varied, this leads to well-defined Gibbs-based MCMC methods found by alternating Metropolis\textendash Hastings updates of the level set function and the hierarchical parameter. These methods demonstrably outperform non-hierarchical Bayesian level set methods.},

These deep structures are probability distributions, designed through hierarchical construction, which are conditionally Gaussian. In this paper, the current published body of work is placed in a common framework and, through recursion, several classes of deep Gaussian processes are defined. The resulting samples generated from a deep Gaussian process have a Markovian structure with respect to the depth parameter, and the effective depth of the resulting process is interpreted in terms of the ergodicity, or non-ergodicity, of the resulting Markov chain. For the classes of deep Gaussian processes introduced, we provide results concerning their ergodicity and hence their effective depth. We also demonstrate how these processes may be used for inference; in particular we show how a Metropolis-within-Gibbs construction across the levels of the hierarchy can be used to derive sampling tools which are robust to the level of resolution used to represent the functions on a computer. For illustration, we consider the effect of ergodicity in some simple numerical examples.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian formulation of inverse problems is attractive for three primary reasons: it provides a clear modelling framework; it allows for principled learning of hyperparameters; and it can provide uncertainty quantification. The posterior distribution may in principle be sampled by means of MCMC or SMC methods, but for many problems it is computationally infeasible to do so. In this situation maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators are often sought. Whilst these are relatively cheap to compute, and have an attractive variational formulation, a key drawback is their lack of invariance under change of parameterization; it is important to study MAP estimators, however, because they provide a link with classical optimization approaches to inverse problems and the Bayesian link may be used to improve upon classical optimization approaches. The lack of invariance of MAP estimators under change of parameterization is a particularly significant issue when hierarchical priors are employed to learn hyperparameters. In this paper we study the effect of the choice of parameterization on MAP estimators when a conditionally Gaussian hierarchical prior distribution is employed. Specifically we consider the centred parameterization, the natural parameterization in which the unknown state is solved for directly, and the noncentred parameterization, which works with a whitened Gaussian as the unknown state variable, and arises naturally when considering dimension-robust MCMC algorithms; MAP estimation is well-defined in the nonparametric setting only for the noncentred parameterization. However, we show that MAP estimates based on the noncentred parameterization are not consistent as estimators of hyperparameters; conversely, we show that limits of finite-dimensional centred MAP estimators are consistent as the dimension tends to infinity. We also consider empirical Bayesian hyperparameter estimation, show consistency of these estimates, and demonstrate that they are more robust with respect to noise than centred MAP estimates. An underpinning concept throughout is that hyperparameters may only be recovered up to measure equivalence, a well-known phenomenon in the context of the Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck process. The applicability of the results is demonstrated concretely with the study of hierarchical Whittle\textendash Mat\'ern and ARD priors.},

We use data recorded by the High Resolution Seismic Network's 3-component seismometers located along the San Andreas Fault. Our results show strong variations in azimuthal surface wave polarizations, Psi, for the paths containing station VARB, one of the closest stations to the San Andreas Fault, synchronous with the Parkfield earthquake. Concerning the other station pair, only smooth temporal variations of Y are observed. Two principal contributions to these changes in Y are identified and separated. They are: (1) slow and weak variations due to seasonal changes in the incident direction of seismic noise; and (2) strong and rapid rotations synchronous with the Parkfield earthquake for paths containing station VARB. Strong shifts in Y are interpreted in terms of changes in crack-induced anisotropy due to the co-seismic rotation of the stress field. Because these changes are only observed on paths containing station VARB, the anisotropic layer responsible for the changes is most likely localized around VARB in the shallow crust. These results suggest that the polarization of surface waves may be very sensitive to changes in the orientations of distributed cracks and that implementation of our technique on a routine basis may prove useful for monitoring stress changes deep within seismogenic zones.

Plots of apparent effective remanent inclination (or skewness corrected for present geomagnetic field inclination) versus time for conjugate basins display the combination of three effects: a gradual increase with time, related to the northward motion of the ridges attached to India in the geomagnetic reference frame; a gap between conjugate curves, which represents anomalous skewness sense stricto; and short-period fluctuations, which represent the sequence effect, i.e., the effect of neighboring magnetic sources on the skewness of a given anomaly. The anomalous skewness decreases with faster spreading rate and completely disappears above 50 km/m.y., an observation which negates geomagnetic field behavior as a possible cause of the observed anomalous skewness.},

  abstract = {It is possible to use the waveform data not only to derive the source mechanism of an earthquake but also to establish the hypocentral coordinates of the `best point source' (the centroid of the stress glut density) at a given frequency. Thus two classical problems of seismology are combined into a single procedure. Given an estimate of the origin time, epicentral coordinates and depth, an initial moment tensor is derived using one of the variations of the method described in detail by Gilbert and Dziewonski (1975). This set of parameters represents the starting values for an iterative procedure in which perturbations to the elements of the moment tensor are found simultaneously with changes in the hypocentral parameters. In general, the method is stable, and convergence rapid. Although the approach is a general one, we present it here in the context of the analysis of long-period body wave data recorded by the instruments of the SRO and ASRO digital network. It appears that the upper magnitude limit of earthquakes that can be processed using this particular approach is between 7.5 and 8.0; the lower limit is, at this time, approximately 5.5, but it could be extended by broadening the passband of the analysis to include energy with periods shorter that 45 s. As there are hundreds of earthquakes each year with magnitudes exceeding 5.5, the seismic source mechanism can now be studied in detail not only for major events but also, for example, for aftershock series. We have investigated the foreshock and several aftershocks of the Sumba earthquake of August 19, 1977; the results show temporal variation of the stress regime in the fault area of the main shock. An area some 150 km to the northwest of the epicenter of the main event became seismically active 49 days later. The sense of the strike-slip mechanism of these events is consistent with the relaxation of the compressive stress in the plate north of the Java trench. Another geophysically interesting result of our analysis is that for 5 out of 11 earthquakes of intermediate and great depth the intermediate principal value of the moment tensor is significant, while for the remaining 6 it is essentially zero, which means that their mechanisms are consistent with a simple double-couple representation. There is clear distinction between these two groups of earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Close examination of the long wavelength shear velocity signal in the lowermost mantle in the wavenumber domain ties several geophysical observations together and leads to fundamental inferences. When mantle shear velocity model S362ANI at a depth of 2800 km is expanded in spherical harmonics up to degree 18, more than one half of the seismic model's total power is contained in a single spherical harmonic coefficient: the ``recumbent'' Y20 spherical harmonic; a Y20 with its axis of symmetry rotated to the equatorial plane. This degree 2 signal, which continues with decreasing amplitude for more than 1000 km above the core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB), is characterized by two antipodal regions of low velocities, separated by a circum-polar torus of higher than average velocities. If the slow regions are associated with net excess mass, then any axis of rotation located in the plane of the circum-polar torus will be close to the maximum moment of inertia axis; this includes, of course, the current axis of rotation. We suggest that the recumbent Y20 is a very stable feature: once established, it is difficult to erase, and only relatively small departures from this equilibrium configuration are possible. This anomaly correlates strongly with the degree 2 terms of the residual geoid expansion, distribution of the hot spots above the slow regions, high attenuation in the transition zone, and position of subduction zones above the fast band during the last 200 Ma. Also, the preferred paths of the virtual geomagnetic pole and true polar wander locations for the last 200 Ma lie within the fast band. Since the non-hydrostatic perturbation of the moment of inertia tensor depends only on degree-2 anomalies in the density distribution and deformation of discontinuities, it is natural to infer that rotational dynamics of the Earth have influenced the distribution of heterogeneities in the Earth's deep interior. We propose that the large-scale heterogeneity at the base of the mantle, which we name Mantle Anchor Structure (MAS) may have formed early in the history of the convecting mantle, remained locked in place with respect to the Earth's rotation axis ever since, and is currently imposing the planform of flow in the mantle and of plate tectonics at the surface.},

The focus of this paper is estimation of time-lapse changes with uncertainty quantification using full-waveform inversion. The purpose of also estimating the uncertainty in the inverted parameters is to be able to use the inverted seismic data quantitatively for updating reservoir models with ensemble-based methods. We perform Bayesian inversion of seismic waveform data in the frequency domain by combining an iterated extended Kalman filter with an explicit representation of the sensitivity matrix in terms of Green functions (acoustic approximation). Using this method, we test different strategies for inversion of the time-lapse seismic data with uncertainty. We compare the results from a sequential strategy (making a prior from the monitor survey using the inverted baseline survey) with a double difference strategy (inverting the difference between the monitor and baseline data). We apply the methods to a subset of the Marmousi2 P-velocity model. Both strategies performed well and relatively good estimates of the monitor velocities and the time-lapse differences were obtained. For the estimated time-lapse differences, the double difference strategy gave the lowest errors.},

Here we develop a gradient-based inversion method to infer the space-dependent and time-varying source power spectral density of the Earth's hum from cross correlations of continuous seismic data. The precomputation of wavefields using spectral elements allows us to account for both finite-frequency sensitivity and for three-dimensional Earth structure. Although similar methods have been proposed previously, they have not yet been applied to data to the best of our knowledge. We apply this method to image the seasonally varying sources of Earth's hum during North and South Hemisphere winter. The resulting models suggest that hum sources are localized, persistent features that occur at Pacific coasts or shelves and in the North Atlantic during North Hemisphere winter, as well as South Pacific coasts and several distinct locations in the Southern Ocean in South Hemisphere winter. The contribution of pelagic sources from the central North Pacific cannot be constrained. Besides improving the accuracy of noise source locations through the incorporation of finite-frequency effects and 3-D Earth structure, this method may be used in future cross-correlation waveform inversion studies to provide initial source models and source model updates.},

This is based on ambient noise cross-correlation inversion using numerical wavefield simulations, which honour 3-D crustal and mantle structure, ocean loading and finite-frequency effects. In the frequency range from 3 to 20 mHz, our results constrain the global source distribution of the Earth's hum, averaged over the Southern Hemisphere winter season of 9 yr. During Southern Hemisphere winter, the dominant sources are largely confined to the Southern Hemisphere, the most prominent exception being the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc, which is the most active source region between 12 and 20 mHz. Generally, strong hum sources seem to be associated with either coastlines or bathymetric highs. In contrast, deep ocean basins are devoid of hum sources. While being based on the relatively small number of STS-1 broad-band stations that have been recording continuously from 2004 to 2013, our results demonstrate the practical feasibility of a frequency-dependent noise source inversion that accounts for the complexities of 3-D wave propagation. It may thereby improve full-waveform ambient noise inversions and our understanding of the physics of noise generation.},

  abstract = {We introduce an array-based approach for constraining seismic velocity structure in the lowermost mantle by measuring the frequency dependence of the ray parameter p and decay constant {$\gamma$} for core-diffracted waves (Pdiff and SHdiff). The approach uses an iterative multichannel cross-correlation algorithm that solves for relative arrival times and amplitudes of core-diffracted waveforms from multiple peaks in normalized correlograms from pairs of coazimuthal stations. The approach is applied to 60 mb {$\geq$} 5.8 earthquakes for Pdiff and 36 for SHdiff during 2001\textendash 2002, with nearly 50,000 unique profile station pairs with epicentral-distance differences of {$\Delta$}d {$\geq$} 10\textdegree{} and azimuth differences of {$\Delta\varphi$} {$\leq$} 10\textdegree, sampling a significant portion of the lowermost mantle. Cap-averaging the resulting ray parameter estimates produces geographic variations that are largely consistent with the distribution of lowermost mantle large low-velocity provinces and seismically fast slab-accumulation regions seen in seismic tomography models, whose locations also strongly influence the geographic distribution of heat flow out of the core. Geographic variations in stationpair diffracted-wave decay constants differ from those of the ray parameters, suggesting that variations in the decay of core-diffracted waves are more linked to lowermost mantle seismic velocity gradients than absolute values of seismic velocity. The ray parameters and decay constants of core-diffracted waves are strongly frequency-dependent, and these frequency variations also vary significantly with geographic location. Combining lateral and vertical seismic-velocity variations with mineral-physics data on elasticity and conductivity of lowermost mantle species can provide constraints on D{${''}$} composition and CMB heat flux. Plain Language Summary We present a means of quantifying the global P- and S-velocity structure of the lowermost mantle using seismic waves that diffract around Earth's core, with an eventual aim toward determining how much heat passes from the core into the mantle. Measuring the rate of heat flow out of the core requires knowing the vertical velocity structure of the lowermost mantle, right above the core-mantle boundary. However, most seismic data provide very poor resolution of this vertical structure or resolution in only a few locations. By using the core-diffracted P and S waves from many earthquakes recorded at many seismometers around the globe, we can map out an averaged vertical velocity structure across the entire core-mantle boundary. Key is that these waves travel around the core at different speeds at different frequencies, a property called dispersion. By measuring and modeling the dispersion of the P and S waves as they diffract around the core, as well as measuring the rates at which the amplitudes of the waves decrease, we can determine a global velocity structure at the core-mantle boundary, and so measure how much heat flows into the mantle from the core.},

An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications.

A fast marching method is used to compute, at each period, surface wave traveltimes and ray paths between sources and receivers. This avoids the assumption of great-circle propagation that is used in most surface wave tomographic studies, but which is not appropriate in complex media. To simplify the problem we consider quasi-stratified media with smoothly varying seismic properties. We represent the 3-D shear wave speed model by means of 1-D profiles beneath grid points, which are determined from all dispersion data simultaneously using a wavelet-based sparsity-constrained tomographic method. The wavelet coefficients of the wave speed model are estimated with an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, and upon iteration the surface wave ray paths and the data sensitivity matrix are updated using the newly obtained wave speed model. To demonstrate its feasibility, we apply the method to determine the 3-D shallow crustal shear wave speed variations in the Taipei basin of Taiwan using short period interstation Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion measurements extracted from the ambient noise cross-correlation method. The results are consistent with previous studies and reveal strong shallow crustal heterogeneity that correlates with surface geology.},

  abstract = {Ill-posed seismic inverse problems are often solved using Tikhonov-type regularization, that is, incorporation of damping and smoothing to obtain stable results. This typically results in overly smooth models, poor amplitude resolution, and a difficult choice between plausible models. Recognizing that the average of parameters can be better constrained than individual parameters, we propose a seismic tomography method that stabilizes the inverse problem by projecting the original high-dimension model space onto random low-dimension subspaces and then infers the high-dimensional solution from combinations of such subspaces. The subspaces are formed by functions constant in Poisson Voronoi cells, which can be viewed as the mean of parameters near a certain location. The low-dimensional problems are better constrained, and image reconstruction of the subspaces does not require explicit regularization. Moreover, the low-dimension subspaces can be recovered by subsets of the whole dataset, which increases efficiency and offers opportunities to mitigate uneven sampling of the model space. The final (highdimension) model is then obtained from the low-dimension images in different subspaces either by solving another normal equation or simply by averaging the low-dimension images. Importantly, model uncertainty can be obtained directly from images in different subspaces. Synthetic tests show that our method outperforms conventional methods both in terms of geometry and amplitude recovery. The application to southern California plate boundary region also validates the robustness of our method by imaging geologically consistent features as well as strong along-strike variations of San Jacinto fault that are not clearly seen using conventional methods.},

  abstract = {P{$>$}The Green's function that describes wave propagation between two receivers can be reconstructed by cross-correlation provided that the receivers are surrounded by sources on a closed surface. This technique is referred to as 'interferometry' in exploration seismology. The same technique for Green's function extraction can be applied to the solution of the diffusion equation if there are sources throughout in the volume. In practice, we have only a finite number of active sources. The issues of the required source distribution is investigated, as is the feasibility of reconstructing the Green's function of the diffusion equation using a limited number of sources within a finite volume. We study these questions for homogeneous and heterogeneous media for wave propagation and homogeneous media for diffusion using numerical simulations. These simulations show that for the used model, the angular distribution of sources is critical in wave problems in homogeneous media. In heterogeneous media, the position and size of the heterogeneous area with respect to the sources determine the required source distribution. For diffusion, the sensitivity to the sources decays from the midpoint between the two receivers. The required width of the source distribution decreases with frequency, with the result that the required source distribution for early- and late-time reconstruction is different. The derived source distribution criterion for diffusion suggests that the cross-correlation-based interferometry is difficult to apply in field condition.},

We propose a theoretical model for the hindered velocity of non-Brownian emulsions and suspensions of nondeformable fluid and solid particles in the creeping flow regime. The model is based on three sets of correction: two on the drag coefficient experienced by each particle to account for both return flow and Smoluchowski effects and a correction on the rheology to account for nonlocal interactions introduced as a mean-field effective viscosity. Our model is tested against new and published experimental data over a wide range of particle volume fraction and viscosity ratio between the fluids. We find an excellent agreement between our model and experiments. The model is then applied to show that hindered settling can increase mineral residence time by up to an order of magnitude in convecting magma chambers.},

  abstract = {The Mexican subduction zone is an ideal location for studying subduction processes due to the short trench-to-coast distances that bring broad portions of the seismogenic and transition zones of the plate interface inland. Using a recently generated seismicity catalog from a local network in Oaxaca, we identified 20 swarms of earthquakes (M {$<$} 5) from 2006 to 2012. Swarms outline what appears to be a steeply dipping structure in the overriding plate, indicative of an origin other than the plate interface. This steeply dipping structure corresponds to the northern boundary of the Xolapa terrane. In addition, we observed an interesting characteristic of slow slip events (SSEs) where they showed a shift from trenchward motion toward an along-strike direction at coastal GPS sites. A majority of the swarms were found to correspond in time to the along-strike shift. We propose that swarms and SSEs are occurring on a sliver fault that allows the oblique convergence to be partitioned into trench-perpendicular motion on the subduction interface and trench-parallel motion on the sliver fault. The resistivity structure surrounding the sliver fault suggests that SSEs and swarms of earthquakes occur due to high fluid content in the fault zone. We propose that the sliver fault provides a natural pathway for buoyant fluids attempting to migrate upward after being released from the downgoing plate. Thus, sliver faults could be responsible for the downdip end of the seismogenic zone by creating drier conditions on the subduction interface trenchward of the sliver fault, promoting fast-slip seismogenic rupture behavior.},

The already-existing telecommunication fiber optic network arises as an ideal solution for this application, owing to its ubiquity and the capacity of optical fibers to perform distributed, highly sensitive monitoring of vibrations at relatively low cost (ultra-high density of point sensors available with minimal deployment of new equipment). This perspective article discusses early approaches on the application of fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensors (DASs) for seismic activity monitoring. The benefits and potential impact of DAS technology in these kinds of applications are here illustrated with new experimental results on teleseism monitoring based on a specific approach: the so-called chirped-pulse DAS. This technology offers promising prospects for the field of seismic tomography due to its appealing properties in terms of simplicity, consistent sensitivity across sensing channels, and robustness. Furthermore, we also report on several signal processing techniques readily applicable to chirped-pulse DAS recordings for extracting relevant seismic information from ambient acoustic noise. The outcome presented here may serve as a foundation for a novel conception for ubiquitous seismic monitoring with minimal investment.},

  abstract = {The adjoint method is a powerful tool in geophysics that permits the computation of the exact first derivative of a physical observable or an associated objective function with respect to its parameters. Typical observables are displacement fields and flow patterns at the surface. Possible geophysical parameters are density, viscosity or elastic coefficients. When the observable can be modelled by solving a differential equation, the computation of the derivative only consists in solving the forward problem and its adjoint problem. Therefore, the adjoint method is far more efficient than any finite difference approximation. Here we present a mathematical formalism that generalises the derivation of the adjoint problem. In order to connect to work by Tarantola [Tarantola, A., 1984. Inversion of seismic reflection data in the acoustic approximation. Geophysics 49 (8), 1259\textendash 1266] we first give a derivation of the adjoint equations for the scalar wave equation in two dimensions. As objective function we choose the L2 distance between the modelled wave field and real data. In this case the adjoint problem coincides with the original forward problem, the only difference being that the adjoint field satisfies terminal rather than initial conditions. A numerical example in two dimensions demonstrates that the adjoint field focusses near the location of a parameter perturbation at the same time when the original wavefront reaches that location. Based on this simple example, we introduce a generalised formalism for the adjoint method. It is independent of the existence of Green's functions and their spatio-temporal reciprocity relations. Moreover, the formalism applies to non-linear equations such as the Navier\textendash Stokes equations. This may become important in mantle flow reconstructions. The source term of the adjoint equations depends only on the specific objective function. Choosing the objective function to coincide with the observable itself allows us the computation of Jacobians, i.e., the derivative of the observable with respect to the model parameters. To demonstrate the consistency of our formalism with earlier analyses, we consider the anisotropic elastic wave equation with attenuation, which is of major interest in seismology. \textcopyright 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Using spectral element simulations of 3-D, viscoelastic, anisotropic wave propagation, we precompute receiver side strain tensors in time and space. This enables the fast computation of synthetic seismograms for any hypothetical source within the volume of interest, and thus a Bayesian solution of the inverse problem. To improve efficiency, we developed a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Taking advantage of easily computable derivatives, numerical examples indicate that Hamiltonian Monte Carlo can converge to the posterior probability density with orders of magnitude less samples than the derivative-free Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which we use for benchmarking. Exact numbers depend on observational errors and the quality of the prior. We apply our method to the Japanese Islands region where we previously constrained 3-D structure of the crust and upper mantle using full-waveform inversion with a minimum period of 15 s.},

  abstract = {We present the theory for and applications of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) solutions of linear and nonlinear tomographic problems. HMC rests on the construction of an artificial Hamiltonian system where a model is treated as a high-dimensional particle moving along a trajectory in an extended model space. Using derivatives of the forward equations, HMC is able to make long-distance moves from the current towards a new independent model, thereby promoting model independence, while maintaining high acceptance rates. Following a brief introduction to HMC using common geophysical terminology, we study linear (tomographic) problems. Though these may not be the main target of Monte Carlo methods, they provide valuable insight into the geometry and the tuning of HMC, including the design of suitable mass matrices and the length of Hamiltonian trajectories. This is complemented by a self-contained proof of the HMC algorithm in Appendix A. A series of tomographic/imaging examples is intended to illustrate (i) different variants of HMC, such as constrained and tempered sampling, (ii) the independence of samples produced by the HMC algorithm and (iii) the effects of tuning on the number of samples required to achieve practically useful convergence. Most importantly, we demonstrate the combination of HMC with adjoint techniques. This allows us to solve a fully nonlinear, probabilistic traveltime tomography with several thousand unknowns on a standard laptop computer, without any need for supercomputing resources.},

This is based on the construction of an artificial Hamiltonian system where a model is treated as a high-dimensional particle. Depending on its initial momentum and mass matrix, the particle evolves along a trajectory that traverses the effective nullspace, thereby producing a series of alternative models that are consistent with observations and their uncertainties. Variants of the nullspace shuttle enable hypothesis testing, for example, by adding features or by producing smoother or rougher models. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian nullspace shuttle can serve as a tunable hybrid between deterministic and probabilistic inversion methods: Choosing random initial momenta, it resembles Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; requiring misfits to decrease along a trajectory, it transforms into gradient descent. We illustrate the concept with a low-dimensional toy example and with high-dimensional nonlinear inversions of seismic traveltimes and magnetic data, respectively.},

In the first part of our study, we examine the observed response spectral (pseudo) accelerations for a selection of periods of engineering significance (1, 3, 6, and 8\,s). Significant ground-motion amplification is present and reproducible between the two events. For the longer periods, coherent spectral acceleration patterns are visible throughout the Los Angeles Basin, while for the shorter periods, the motions are less spatially coherent. However, coherence is still observable at smaller length scales due to the high spatial density of the measurements. Examining possible correlations of the computed response spectral accelerations with basement depth and Vs30, we find the correlations to be stronger for the longer periods. In the second part of the study, we test the performance of two state-of-the-art methods for estimating ground motions for the largest event of the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, namely three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference simulations and ground motion prediction equations. For the simulations, we are interested in the performance of the two Southern California Earthquake Center 3D community velocity models (CVM-S and CVM-H). For the ground motion prediction equations, we consider four of the 2014 Next Generation Attenuation-West2 Project equations. For some cases, the methods match the observations reasonably well; however, neither approach is able to reproduce the specific locations of the maximum response spectral accelerations or match the details of the observed amplification patterns.},

To perform the study, the indirect boundary element method is used, which has proved to be a powerful tool for numerical modeling of problems in elastodynamics. In essence, the method expresses the diffracted wave field of stresses, pressures, and displacements by a boundary integral, also known as single-layer representation, whose shape can be regarded as a Fredholm's integral representation of second kind and zero order. This representation can be considered as an exemplification of Huygens' principle, which is equivalent to Somigliana's representation theorem. Results in frequency domain for the three types of interfaces are presented; then, using the fourier discrete transform, we derive the results in time domain, where the emergence of interface waves is highlighted.},

We show that conversions of shear to compressional waves (Sp) across the base of the lithosphere are systematically weaker on the western side of the plate boundary, indicating that the drop in seismic shear-wave velocity from lithosphere to asthenosphere is either smaller or occurs over a larger depth range. In central and northern California, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary changes character across a distance of {$<$}50 km, and does so directly beneath the San Andreas fault along its simple central segment, and beneath the Calaveras-Green Valley-Bartlett Springs faults to the north. Given the absolute velocities of the North America and Pacific plates, and low viscosities inferred for the asthenosphere, these results indicate the juxtaposition of mantle lithospheres with different properties across these faults. The spatial correlation between the central San Andreas fault and the laterally abrupt change in the velocity structure of the deepest mantle lithosphere points to the accommodation of relative plate motion on a narrow shear zone ({$<$}50 km in width), and a rheology that enables strain localization throughout the thickness of the lithosphere.},

On the basis of geodynamic computations, plumes of purely thermal origin should comprise thin tails, only several hundred kilometres wide, and be difficult to detect using standard seismic tomography techniques. Here we describe the use of a whole-mantle seismic imaging technique--combining accurate wavefield computations with information contained in whole seismic waveforms--that reveals the presence of broad (not thin), quasi-vertical conduits beneath many prominent hotspots. These conduits extend from the core-mantle boundary to about 1,000 kilometres below Earth's surface, where some are deflected horizontally, as though entrained into more vigorous upper-mantle circulation. At the base of the mantle, these conduits are rooted in patches of greatly reduced shear velocity that, in the case of Hawaii, Iceland and Samoa, correspond to the locations of known large ultralow-velocity zones. This correspondence clearly establishes a continuous connection between such zones and mantle plumes. We also show that the imaged conduits are robustly broader than classical thermal plume tails, suggesting that they are long-lived, and may have a thermochemical origin. Their vertical orientation suggests very sluggish background circulation below depths of 1,000 kilometres. Our results should provide constraints on studies of viscosity layering of Earth's mantle and guide further research into thermochemical convection.},

  abstract = {The seismic wavefield mainly contains reflected, refracted and direct waves but energy related to elastic scattering can also be identified at frequencies of 1 Hz and higher. The scattered, highfrequency seismic wavefield contains information on the small-scale structure of the Earth's crust, mantle and core. Due to the high thermal conductivity of mantle materials causing rapid dissipation of thermal anomalies, the Earth's small-scale structure most likely reveals details of the composition of the interior, and, is therefore essential for our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Earth. Using specific ray configurations we can identify scattered energy originating in the lower mantle and under certain circumstances locate its point of origin in the Earth allowing further insight into the structure of the lowermost mantle. Here we present evidence, from scattered PKP waves, for a heterogeneous structure at the core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB) beneath southern Africa. The structure rises approximately 80 km above the CMB and is located at the eastern edge of the African LLSVP. Mining-related and tectonic seismic events in South Africa, with mb from 3.2 to 6.0 recorded at epicentral distances of 119.3{$\smwhtcircle$} to 138.8{$\smwhtcircle$} from Yellowknife Array (YKA) (Canada), show large amplitude precursors to PKPdf arriving 3\textendash 15 s prior to the main phase. We use array processing to measure slowness and backazimuth of the scattered energy and determine the scatterer location in the deep Earth. To improve the resolution of the slowness vector at the medium aperture YKA we present a new application of the F-statistic. The high-resolution slowness and backazimuth measurements indicate scattering from a structure up to 80 km tall at the CMB with lateral dimensions of at least 1200 km by 300 km, at the edge of the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province. The forward scattering nature of the PKP probe indicates that this is velocity-type scattering resulting primarily from changes in elastic parameters. The PKP scattering data are in agreement with dynamically supported dense material related to the Large Low Shear Velocity Province.},

  abstract = {The Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the lower mantle represent volumetrically significant thermal or chemical or thermo-chemical heterogeneities. Their structure and boundaries have been widely studied, mainly using S-waves, but much less is known about their signature in the P-wavefield. We use an extensive dataset recorded at USArray to create, for the first time, a high-resolution map of the location, shape, sharpness, and extent of the boundary of the Pacific LLSVP using P(P-diff)-waves. We find that the northern edge of the Pacific LLSVP is shallow dipping (26 degrees relative to the horizontal) and diffuse (similar to 120 km wide transition zone) whereas the eastern edge is steeper dipping (70 degrees) and apparently sharp (similar to 40 km wide). We trace the LLSVP boundary up to similar to 500 km above the CMB in most areas, and 700 km between 120 degrees and 90 degrees W at the eastern extent of the boundary. Apparent P-wave velocity drops are similar to 1-3\% relative to PREM, indicating a strong influence of LLSVPs on P-wave velocity, at least in the high-frequency wavefield, in contrast to previous studies. A localised patch with a greater velocity drop of similar to 15-25\% is detected, defined by large magnitude gradients of the travel-time residuals. We identify this as a likely location of an Ultra-Low Velocity Zone (ULVZ), matching the location of a previously detected ULVZ in this area. The boundary of a separate low velocity anomaly, of a similar height to the LLSVP, is detected in the north-west Pacific, matching tomographic images. This outlier appears to be connected to the main LLSVP through a narrow channel close to the CMB and may be in the process of joining or splitting from the main LLSVP. We also see strong velocity increases in the lower mantle to the east of the LLSVP, likely detecting subducted material beneath central America. The LLSVP P-wave boundary is similar to that determined in high-resolution S-wave studies and follows the -0.4\% Delta V-S iso-velocity contour in the S4ORTS tomography model. Additionally, the LLSVP boundary roughly matches the shape of the -0.4\% Delta V-P iso-velocity contour of the P-wave model GyPSuM but defines an area more similar to that defined by the 0.0\% V-P iso-velocity contour. High resolution P-wave velocity determination allows for estimation of the ratio of P- and S-wave velocity anomalies (R-S,R-P) which can be used to indicate dominantly thermal or chemical control of seismic velocities. Although the R-S,R-P is found here to be approximately 2.4, which is indicative of a thermo-chemical anomaly. However, this result contains a large amount of uncertainty and the implications for the origin of LLSVPs likely remain inconclusive. Nonetheless, other observations of the Pacific LLSVP are consistent with a thermo-chemical anomaly whose shape and boundary sharpness are controlled by proximity to active and past subduction.

Spectral analysis indicates that the dominant scale length of the heterogeneity is 4 to 7 km. The heterogeneity distribution varies laterally and radially and heterogeneities are more abundant near the margins of the lowermost mantle Large Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs), consistent with mantle convection simulations that show elevated accumulations of deeply advected crustal material near the boundaries of thermo-chemical piles. The size and distribution of the observed heterogeneities is consistent with that expected for subducted oceanic crust. These results thus suggest the deep mantle contains an imprint of continued subduction of oceanic crust, stirred by mantle convection and modulated by long lasting thermo-chemical structures. The preferred location of the heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle is consistent with a thermo-chemical origin of the LLVPs. Our observations relate to the mixing behaviour of small length-scale heterogeneity in the deep Earth and indicate that compositional heterogeneities from the subduction process can survive for extended times in the lowermost mantle.},

Essential parameters in any model to describe these phenomena are the mantle's compositional and thermal structure. Most samples of the mantle come from the lithosphere. Although the composition of the underlying asthenospheric mantle can be estimated, this is made difficult by the fact that this part of the mantle partially melts and differentiates before samples ever reach the surface. The composition and conditions in the mantle at depths significantly below the lithosphere must be interpreted from geophysical observations combined with experimental data on mineral and rock properties. Fortunately, the transition zone, which extends from approximately 410 to 660 km, has a number of characteristic globally observed seismic properties that should ultimately place essential constraints on the compositional and thermal state of the mantle.},

The chief result of this survey is an interpreted cross section that addresses a number of questions regarding the crustal structure and tectonics of southern California that have been debated for decades and have important implications for earthquake hazard assessment. The results (or constraints) are as follows. (1) The maximum depth of the Los Angeles basin along line 1 is 8-9 km, (2) The deep structure of the Sierra Madre fault zone in the northern San Gabriel Valley is as follows. The Duarte branch of the Sierra Madre fault zone forms a buried, 2.5-km-high, moderately north dipping buttress between the sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the San Gabriel Valley and the igneous and metamorphic rocks of the San Gabriel Mountains. (For deeper structure, see following.) (3) There are active crustal decollements in southern California. At middle-crustal depths, the Sierra Madre fault zone appears to sole into a master decollement that terminates northward at the San Andreas fault and projects southward beneath the San Gabriel Valley to the Puente Hills blind thrust fault. (4) The dip and depth extent of the San Andreas fault along line 1 dips steeply (similar to 83 degrees) northward and extends to at least the Moho, (5) The subsurface lateral extent of the Pelona Schist in southern California is as follows, Along line 1, the Pelona Schist underlies much, if not all of the San Gabriel Mountains south of the San Andreas fault to middle-crustal depths. North of the San Andreas fault, it is apparently not present along the transect.},

  abstract = {We present an extension of the method recently introduced by Zhao \& Chevrot for calculating Frechet kernels from a precomputed database of strain Green's tensors by normal mode summation. The extension involves two aspects: (1) we compute the strain Green's tensors using the Direct Solution Method, which allows us to go up to frequencies as high as 1 Hz; and (2) we develop a spatial interpolation scheme so that the Green's tensors can be computed with a relatively coarse grid, thus improving the efficiency in the computation of the sensitivity kernels. The only requirement is that the Green's tensors be computed with a fine enough spatial sampling rate to avoid spatial aliasing. The Green's tensors can then be interpolated to any location inside the Earth, avoiding the need to store and retrieve strain Green's tensors for a fine sampling grid. The interpolation scheme not only significantly reduces the CPU time required to calculate the Green's tensor database and the disk space to store it, but also enhances the efficiency in computing the kernels by reducing the number of I/O operations needed to retrieve the Green's tensors. Our new implementation allows us to calculate sensitivity kernels for high-frequency teleseismic body waves with very modest computational resources such as a laptop. We illustrate the potential of our approach for seismic tomography by computing traveltime and amplitude sensitivity kernels for high frequency P, PKP and Pdiff phases. A comparison of our PKP kernels with those computed by asymptotic ray theory clearly shows the limits of the latter. With ray theory, it is not possible to model waves diffracted by internal discontinuities such as the coremantle boundary, and it is also difficult to compute amplitudes for paths close to the B-caustic of the PKP phase. We also compute waveform partial derivatives for different parts of the seismic wavefield, a key ingredient for high resolution imaging by waveform inversion. Our computations of partial derivatives in the time window where PcP precursors are commonly observed show that the distribution of sensitivity is complex and counter-intuitive, with a large contribution from the mid-mantle region. This clearly emphasizes the need to use accurate and complete partial derivatives in waveform inversion.},

The Mw 6.2 Amatrice event (24 August) was the first one, causing building collapse and about 300 casualties. The event was recorded by a uniquely dense network of seismic stations. Here we perform its dynamic source inversion to infer the fault friction parameters and stress conditions that controlled the earthquake rupture. We consider a linear slip-weakening friction law with spatially variable parameters along the fault. The inversion uses a novel Bayesian framework developed in our companion paper, which combines efficient finite-difference dynamic rupture simulations and the Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo algorithm to sample the posterior probability density function. The main advantage of such formulation is that by subsequent analysis of the posterior samples we can infer stable features of the result and their uncertainty. The inversion results in a million of visited models. The preferred model ensemble reveals intriguing dynamic features. The rupture exhibits a slow and irregular nucleation followed by bilateral rupture propagation through two asperities, accelerating toward the heavily damaged city of Amatrice. The stress drop reaches locally 10\textendash 15 MPa, with slip-weighted mean of 4\textendash 4.5 MPa. The friction drop ranges from 0.1 to 0.4. The characteristic slip-weakening distance is the most heterogeneously distributed dynamic parameter, with values of 0.2\textendash 0.8 m. The radiation efficiency was rather low, 0.2, suggesting that approximately 80\% of the total available energy was spent in the fracture process, while just 20\% was radiated by seismic waves.},

  abstract = {Inversion of surface wave data for crustal and upper-mantle structure is a staple of passive seismology, particularly since the advent of techniques enabling surface wave dispersion (SWD) and Rayleigh wave ellipticity measurements from ambient noise. Recent development and application of transdimensional Bayesian (TB) seismic inversion offers an approach to quantify model parameter uncertainties and trade-offs with fewer assumptions than traditional methods. Using synthetic tests, we investigate choices in the implementation of TB for the inversion of SWD and Rayleigh wave ellipticity to constrain the structure of Earth's continental lithosphere. We focus on three aspects of the inversion: limitation of data sensitivity, assumed scaling among parameters (compressional wave speed, Vp, shear wave speed, Vs, density and radial anisotropy) and parametrization choices. We show that while surface wave data provide relatively strong constraints on the posterior distribution of Vs and, to a lesser extent, Vp, common parametrization choices can potentially bias structure estimates. This is particularly the case for radial anisotropy ({$\xi$} ), due to the inability to distinguish variations of Vp and density from those of {$\xi$} . Inferred results therefore depend substantially on the parametrization and scaling choices. We illustrate how layered parametrizations can, in the TB framework, recover smoothly varying profiles, and quantify the number of layers recoverable at different levels of measurement uncertainty. Finally, we propose two types of model parametrization for TB inversion involving multiple types of parameters. We demonstrate that by implementing an independent parametrization for different physical quantities, we can avoid imposing identical model geometry across multiple types of model parameters, and obtain better model estimates with reduced trade-offs. We advocate for such a parametrization in TB inversion of radial anisotropy using surface wave data, and when targeting disparate Vp and Vs structures such as those associated with {$\alpha$}-{$\beta$} quartz transtion.},

The diagnosis was made from the observation of late-arriving S phases with large amplitudes, localized in the zones of large damage. The azimuths and angles of incidence of the seismic rays that give rise to the greatest focusing effects correspond to radiation that would have emerged from the lower part of the rupture surface of the mainshock. Thus the focusing and, hence, the large damage in Santa Monica were highly dependent on the location of the Northridge event, and an earthquake of similar size, located as little as one source dimension away, would not be likely to repeat this pattern. We show from coda wave analysis that the influence of surface geology as well as site effects on damage in Santa Monica is significantly smaller than are the focusing effects.},

In this paper we propose a new version of such a methodology, a framework for its analysis, and numerical evidence of the practicality of the method proposed. Our starting point is an ensemble of overdamped Langevin diffusions which interact through a single preconditioner computed as the empirical ensemble covariance. We demonstrate that the nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation arising from the mean-field limit of the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE) has a novel gradient flow structure, built on the Wasserstein metric and the covariance matrix of the noisy flow. Using this structure, we investigate large time properties of the Fokker--Planck equation, showing that its invariant measure coincides with that of a single Langevin diffusion, and demonstrating exponential convergence to the invariant measure in a number of settings. We introduce a new noisy variant on ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithms found from the original SDE by replacing exact gradients with ensemble differences; this defines the ensemble Kalman sampler (EKS). Numerical results are presented which demonstrate its efficacy as a derivative-free approximate sampler for the Bayesian posterior arising from inverse problems.},

However, the various large wavelength seismological models of the CMB topography, which have been obtained up to now, are poorly correlated. Moreover, their maximum amplitudes vary considerably from one model to another, with values ranging from "4 to "12 km. These large discrepancies may be due to the difficulty to separate, in the travel time anomalies, the contribution of the CMB topography from that of the highly heterogeneous DY region at the base of the mantle. In order to better constrain the amplitude of the CMB topography, we perform a stochastic analysis of the core phases which sample the CMB as transmitted waves andror as reflected waves. In particular, we analyse underside reflected PKKP phases, which help to discriminate between CMB topography and DY structure, and have in addition a great sensitivity to CMB topography. The other phases used are the upperside reflected waves PcP, and the transmitted waves PKP. The analysis is performed on the travel time residual file obtained by Engdahl et al. wEngdahl, E.R., van der Hilst, R., Buland, R.P., 1998.

After careful travel time data selection, the stochastic analysis allows us to separate coherent signal from random signal in the data at different length scales ranging from 300 to 1500 km. Then the CMB topography variance is obtained at the different length scales from a joint analysis of the coherent signal in the different core phases, in taking into account their different sensitivities to CMB topography. The estimated CMB topography variance has a significant signal in the wavelength range that we have investigated, showing that 95\% of CMB topography amplitude is in the range "; 4.0 km for wavelengths larger than 300 km. This value decreases to "; 1.5 km for wavelengths larger than 1200 km, indicating that the long wavelength CMB topography is significantly lower than previously proposed. However, it has not been possible to invert the data for deriving a map of the CMB topography. A checkerboard pattern analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of the PKKP phase, the relative contributions of DY heterogenieties and CMB topography cannot be separated with the presently available data. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mantle materials that surround these anomalous regions are thought to be composed of cooler rocks associated with downward advection of former oceanic tectonic plates.

Yet, they may also be chemically distinct from the surrounding mantle, and potentially partly composed of subducted or primordial material, and have therefore been termed thermochemical piles. From seismic, geochemical and mineral physics data, the emerging view is that these thermochemical piles appear denser than the surrounding mantle materials, are dynamically stable and long-lived, and are shaped by larger-scale mantle flow. Whether remnants of a primordial layer or later accumulations of more-dense materials, the composition of the piles is modified over time by stirring and by chemical reactions with material from the surrounding mantle, underlying core and potentially from volatile elements transported into the deep Earth by subducted plates. Upwelling mantle plumes may originate from the thermochemical piles, so the unusual chemical composition of the piles could be the source of distinct trace-element signatures observed in hotspot lavas.},

This is based on (1) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution, (2) the computation of misfit derivatives using adjoint techniques, and (3) a mass matrix tuning of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm that accounts for the different sensitivities of seismic velocities and density. We apply our method to two synthetic end-member scenarios with different dimension D that are particularly relevant in the context of full-waveform inversion: low-dimensional models (D {$<$} 100) with potentially large variations in material parameters and high-dimensional models (D {$>$} 30,000) describing smaller-scale variations of lower amplitude relative to some background. For both end members, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling reliably recovers important aspects of the posterior, including means, covariances, skewness, and 1-D and 2-D marginals. Depending on the strength of material variations, the posterior can be significantly non-Gaussian. This suggests to replace local methods for uncertainty quantification based on Gaussian assumptions by proper sampling of the posterior. In addition to P wave and S wave velocity, the sampling provides constraints on density structure that are free from subjective regularization artifacts.},

We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-t family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

  abstract = {It has long been accepted that occurrences of a known signal are most effectively detected by cross-correlating the incoming data stream with a waveform template. Such matched signal detectors have received very little attention in the field of detection seismology because there are relatively few instances in which the form of an anticipated seismic signal is known apriori. Repeating events in highly confined geographical regions have been observed to produce very similar waveforms and good signals from events at a given site can be exploited to detect subsequent co-located events at lower magnitudes than would be possible using traditional power detectors. Even greater improvement in signal detectability can be achieved using seismic arrays; running correlation coefficients from single sensors can be stacked over an array or network to result in a network correlation coefficient displaying a significant array gain. If two events are co-located, the time separating the corresponding patterns in the wave train as indicated by the cross-correlation function is identical for all seismic stations and this property means that the correlation coefficient traces are coherent even when the waveforms are not. We illustrate the power of array-based waveform correlation using the 1997 August 16 Kara Sea event. The weak event that occurred 4 hr after the main event was barely detected using an STA/LTA detector on the SPITS array but is readily detected by signal matching on a single channel. The main event was also recorded by the far more distant NORSAR array but no conventional detection can be made for the second event. A clear detection is, however, made when the correlation coefficient traces are beamformed over all sensors of the array. We estimate the reduction in detection threshold of a test signal on a regional seismic array using waveform correlation by scaling down a master signal and immersing it into seismic noise. We show that, for this case, waveform correlation using a single channel detects signals of approximately 0.7 orders of magnitude lower than is possible using an STA/LTA detector on the array beam. Waveform matching on the full array provides an additional improvement of approximately 0.4 magnitude units. We describe a case study in which small seismic events at the Barentsburg coal mine on Spitsbergen were detected using the signals from a major rockburst as master waveforms. Many spurious triggers occurred in this study whereby short sections of signal exhibited coincidental similarity with unrelated incoming wave fronts. We demonstrate how such false alarms can almost always be identified and screened out automatically by performing frequency-wavenumber analysis upon the set of individual correlation coefficient traces.},

However, little work has been devoted to predict shorter period seismic waves recorded in coastal regions. Here we present an analytical framework that relates the signature of seismic noise recorded at 0.6\textendash 2 s periods (0.5\textendash 1.5 Hz frequencies) in coastal regions with deep-ocean wave properties. Constraints on key model parameters such as seismic attenuation and ocean wave directionality are provided by jointly analyzing ocean-floor acoustic noise and seismic noise measurements. We show that 0.6\textendash 2 s seismic noise can be consistently predicted over the entire year. The seismic noise recorded in this period range is mostly caused by local wind-waves, i.e. by wind-waves occurring within about 2000 km of the seismic station. Our analysis also shows that the fraction of ocean waves traveling in nearly opposite directions is orders of magnitude smaller than previously suggested for wind-waves, does not depend strongly on wind speed as previously proposed, and instead may depend weakly on the heterogeneity of the wind field. This study suggests that wind-wave conditions can be studied in detail from seismic observations, including under specific conditions such as in the presence of sea ice.},

We observe intermittent subglacial water pressure gradient changes during the melt season, at odds with common assumptions of slowly varying, low-pressure channels. These observations indicate that changes in channel size do not keep pace with changes in discharge. This behavior strongly affects glacier dynamics and subglacial channel erosion at Mendenhall Glacier, where episodic periods of high water pressure gradients enhance glacier surface velocity and channel sediment transport by up to 30\% and 50\%, respectively. We expect the application of this framework to future seismic observations acquired at glaciers worldwide to improve our understanding of subglacial processes.},

The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis\textendash Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain.The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/ research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

  abstract = {Linking volcano-seismic signals with subsurface processes is crucial to improve the forecasting of volcanic eruptions. One of the most enigmatic signals is shallow volcanic tremor, a highly periodic ground vibration that is typically sourced beneath the crater of active volcanoes, is long lasting (from minutes to years), appears during unrest periods, and frequently precedes eruptions. In this paper, we demonstrate that shallow tremor can be produced by periodic pressure oscillations emerging spontaneously beneath permeable media (e.g., fractured magma caps). These pressure oscillations are the result of three concurrent processes: (a) the transient porous flow of gases through the permeable cap; (b) the temporary accumulation of these gases beneath the cap, forming a gas pocket; and (c) the random supply of volatiles from deeper levels. For highly permeable media ({$\geq$}10-12 m2; realistic for shallow volcanic edifices), the pressure in subsurface gas pockets is governed by the equation of a linear oscillator; hence, under proper conditions, periodic pressure oscillations emerge during the transfer of gases from the Earth's interior to the surface. Our model is consistent with geophysical data showing that the tremor source is localized at a fixed region and can explain the main characteristics of ground vibrations, including frequency gliding, variations of seismic amplitude prior to eruptions, and the different types of tremor observed. For thin permeable caps ({$<$}100 m), we find that different eruption mechanisms (e.g., magma ascent vs. cap sealing) leave distinct footprints in the tremor properties, thus opening new perspectives to forecast the type and style of impending eruptions.},

  abstract = {Detailed reconstruction of deep structures with full-waveform inversion (FWI) of wideangle ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) data remains challenging and unconventional. The complexity of the long-offset waveforms increases the nonlinearity of the inverse problem, while the sparsity of the OBS deployments leads to a poorly constrained model reconstruction. Consequently, for such a FWI setting it is difficult to derive an initial model that satisfies the cycle-skipping criterion. Searching for a remedy to this issue, we investigate the graph-space optimal transport (GSOT) technique, which can potentially overcome the cycle-skipping problem at the initial FWI stage. The key feature of the GSOT cost function is the convexity with respect to the patterns in the two seismograms, which allows for correct matching of the arrivals shifted in time for more than half of the wavelet. This in turn shall allow FWI to handle the large kinematic errors of the starting model. We test this hypothesis by applying the time-domain acoustic FWI to the synthetic and field data from the subduction zone environment. We show that despite the complexity of the geological structure, the GSOT misfit function is able to guide the FWI toward the precise velocity model reconstruction and data fitting starting from a simple 1D model. The improved convexity of the GSOT misfit function allows FWI to converge even when mismatches between the observed and synthetic signals reach a few cycles. This ability reduces the constraint on the kinematic accuracy of the initial model and makes the FWI from the OBS data more feasible.},

The proposed inverse method is based on a Bayesian approach under the assumptions of a Gaussian mixture random field for the prior model and a Gaussian linear likelihood function. The model for the latent discrete variable is defined to be a stationary firstorder Markov chain. In this approach, a recursive exact solution to an approximation of the posterior distribution of the inverse problem is proposed. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm can be used to efficiently simulate realizations from the correct posterior model. Two inversion studies based on real well log data are presented, and the main results are the posterior distributions of the reservoir properties of interest, the corresponding predictions and prediction intervals, and a set of conditional realizations. The first application is a seismic inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, P- and S-impedance, where an improvement of 30\% in the root-mean-square error of the predictions compared to the traditional Gaussian inversion is obtained. The second application is a rock physics inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, porosity, and clay volume, where predictions slightly improve compared to the Gaussian inversion approach.},

In our approach, fault rupture is represented kinematically and incorporates spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture speed, and rise time. The prescribed slip distribution is constrained to follow an inverse wavenumber-squared fall-off and the average rupture speed is set at 80\% of the local shear-wave velocity, which is then adjusted such that the rupture propagates faster in regions of high slip and slower in regions of low slip. We use a Kostrov-like slip-rate function having a rise time proportional to the square root of slip, with the average rise time across the entire fault constrained empirically. Recent observations from large surface rupturing earthquakes indicate a reduction of rupture propagation speed and lengthening of rise time in the near surface, which we model by applying a 70\% reduction of the rupture speed and increasing the rise time by a factor of 2 in a zone extending from the surface to a depth of 5 km. We demonstrate the fidelity of the technique by modeling the strong-motion recordings from the Imperial Valley, Loma Prieta, Landers, and Northridge earthquakes.},

The comparison of results obtained using the staggered-grid technique with those obtained using a frequency-wavenumber algorithm shows excellent agreement between the two methods for a variety of models. In addition, this article also introduces a memory optimization procedure that allows large-scale 3D finite-difference problems to be computed on a conventional, single-processor desktop workstation. With this technique, model storage is accommodated using both external (hard-disk)and internal (core) memory. To reduce system overhead, a cascaded time update procedure is utilized to maximize the number of computations performed between I/O operations. This formulation greatly expands the applicability of the 3D finite-difference technique by providing an efficient and practical algorithm for implementation on commonly available workstation platforms.},

  abstract = {Variations in the Earth's lower mantle appear to influence the geodynamo operating in the liquid core. We present a solution to the full dynamo equations with lateral variations in heat flux on the outer boundary defined by the shear wave velocity of the lowermost mantle. The magnetic field is almost stationary and locked to the boundary, with 4 symmetrical concentrations of flux sited beneath cold mantle. This allows for the first time a direct comparison between a dynamo solution and the main features of the present geomagnetic field. Of the four main equatorially symmetric flux lobes, two (the ``Siberian'' pair) are centered within 5{$\smwhtcircle$} of the corresponding Earth's pair; the other two (the ``Canadian'' pair) are not quite so close but are more mobile, as the corresponding Earth's pair have been in the last 300 years. Our study strongly suggests that geomagnetic field morphology is dominated not only by geometry related to the inner core but also by structure in the bottom few hundred kilometres of the mantle, notably the seismically fast ring beneath the Pacific rim and large fast anomalies beneath Siberia and Canada. Tighter locking of one of the pairs of flux lobes suggests the seismic anomaly beneath the Siberian side of the ring is in some way stronger than the one on the Canadian side. These locked solutions only occur for a limited parameter range with the large Ekman numbers available to numerical experiments, which explains why none have been found earlier. This solution provides an important starting point for further searches for dynamos with realistic geomagnetic fields.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a new derivative-free optimization method and investigate its use for training neural networks. Our method is motivated by the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), which has been used successfully for solving optimization problems that involve large-scale, highly nonlinear dynamical systems. A key benefit of the EnKF method is that it requires only the evaluation of the forward propagation but not its derivatives. Hence, in the context of neural networks it alleviates the need for back propagation and reduces the memory consumption dramatically. However, the method is not a pure "black-box" global optimization heuristic as it efficiently utilizes the structure of typical learning problems. Promising first results of the EnKF for training deep neural networks have been presented recently by Kovachki and Stuart. We propose an important modification of the EnKF that enables us to prove convergence of our method to the minimizer of a strongly convex function. Our method also bears similarity with implicit filtering and we demonstrate its potential for minimizing highly oscillatory functions using a simple example. Further, we provide numerical examples that demonstrate the potential of our method for training deep neural networks.},

The ill-posed nature of the problem entails the incorporation of regularization techniques. The consequent non-stochastic error introduced by regularization needs to be taken into account when choosing an experimental design criterion. We discuss different ways to define an optimal design that controls both an average total error of regularized estimates and a measure of the total cost of the design. We also introduce a numerical framework that efficiently implements such designs and natively allows for the solution of large-scale problems. To illustrate the possible applications of the methodology, we consider a borehole tomography example and a two-dimensional function recovery problem.},

We demonstrate that these claims are unjustified. Stochastic simulations with Poissonian background activity and triggered Omoritype aftershock sequences are shown to reproduce the interevent-time distributions observed on different spatial and magnitude scales in California. Thus the empirical distribution can be explained without any additional long-term clustering. Furthermore, we find that the shape of the interevent-time distribution, which can be approximated by the gamma distribution, is determined by the percentage of mainshocks in the catalog. This percentage can be calculated by the mean and variance of the interevent times and varies between 5\% and 90\% for different regions in California. Our investigation of stochastic simulations indicates that the intereventtime distribution provides a nonparametric reconstruction of the mainshock magnitude-frequency distribution that is superior to standard declustering algorithm.},

  abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed\textemdash either explicitly or implicitly\textemdash to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an m \texttimes{} n matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require O(mn log(k)) floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to O(mnk) for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to O(k) passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.},

From the northern Salton Sea to the southern Imperial Valley, the crust is 17\textendash 18 km thick and approximately one-dimensional. The transition at depth from Colorado River sediment to underlying crystalline rock is gradual and is not a depositional surface. The crystalline rock from \textasciitilde 3 to \textasciitilde 8 km depth is interpreted as sediment metamorphosed by high heat flow. Deeper felsic crystalline rock could be stretched preexisting crust or higher-grade metamorphosed sediment. The lower crust below \textasciitilde 12 km depth is interpreted to be gabbro emplaced by rift-related magmatic intrusion by underplating. Low upper mantle velocity indicates high temperature and partial melting. Under the Coachella Valley, sediment thins to the north and the underlying crystalline rock is interpreted as granitic basement. Mafic rock does not exist at 12\textendash 18 km depth as it does to the south, and a weak reflection suggests Moho at \textasciitilde 28 km depth. Structure in adjacent Mexico has slower midcrustal velocity, and rocks with mantle velocity must be much deeper than in the Imperial Valley. Slower velocity and thicker crust in the Coachella and Mexicali valleys define the rift zone between them to be {$>$}100 km wide in the direction of plate motion. North American lithosphere in the central Salton Trough has been rifted apart and is being replaced by new crust created by magmatism, sedimentation, and metamorphism.},

Within the context of surface wave inversion, the Dix-type relation we derive for surface waves allows accurate depth profiles of shear-wave velocity to be constructed directly from phase velocity data, in contrast to perturbational methods. The depth profiles can subsequently be used as an initial model for nonlinear inversion. We provide examples of the Dix-type relation for under-parameterized and over-parameterized cases. In the under-parameterized case, we use the theory to estimate crustal thickness, crustal shear-wave velocity, and mantle shear-wave velocity across the Western U.S. from phase velocity maps measured at 8-, 20-, and 40-s periods. By adopting a thin-layer formalism and an over-parameterized model, we show how a regularized inversion based on the Dix-type relation yields smooth depth profiles of shearwave velocity. In the process, we quantitatively demonstrate the depth sensitivity of surface-wave phase velocity as a function of frequency and the accuracy of the Dix-type relation. We apply the over-parameterized approach to a nearsurface data set within the frequency band from 5 to 40 Hz and find overall agreement between the inverted model and the result of full nonlinear inversion.},

In practice, the nonperturbational method can be used to provide a good starting model that can be iteratively improved with the perturbational method. Although the perturbational method is well-known, we solve the forward problem using an eigenvalue/eigenvector solver instead of the conventional approach of root finding. Features of the codes include the ability to handle any mix of phase or group velocity measurements, combinations of modes of any order, the presence of a surface water layer, computation of partial derivatives due to changes in material properties and layer boundaries, and the implementation of an automatic grid of layers that is optimally suited for the depth sensitivity of Rayleigh waves.},

We examine the issue of parasitic modes that arises for modeling Love waves, in contrast to the Rayleigh wave case, and how to discern parasitic from physical modes. Once the matrix eigenvector-eigenvalue problem has been solved for Love waves, we show a straightforward technique to obtain sensitivity kernels for S-wave velocity and density. In practice, the sensitivity of Love waves to density is relatively small and inversions only aim to estimate the S-wave velocity. Two types of inversion accompany the forward-modeling codes: One is a perturbational scheme for updating an initial model, and the other is a nonperturbational method that is well-suited for defining a good initial model. The codes are able to implement an optimal nonuniform layering designed for Love waves, invert combinations of phase and group velocity measurements of any mode, and seamlessly handle the transition from guided to leaky modes below the cutoff frequency. Two software examples demonstrate use of the codes at near-surface and crustal scales.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that measurements of minor-arc fundamental-mode (FM) Rayleigh waves experience interference from major-arc overtones, resulting in travel-time and amplitude measurements oscillating along a ray path. The oscillations are present in synthetic seismograms generated in a 3-D Earth model via SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE and in a 1-D Earth model by mode summation. The absence of oscillations in synthetics containing only the FM indicates that the oscillations originate from higher-mode interference. This interference is present across multiple measurement techniques, including multi-channel cross correlation, phase-matched filtering, and cluster analysis. Experiments with 1-D synthetics suggest that contamination from interference is largest at epicentral distances greater than around 120 degrees, where record sections of seismograms show the major-arc overtones intersecting the minor-arc FM Rayleigh wave. The short wavelength of the interference pattern means it is only observable with dense station spacing and high data quality, which may explain why it has not, to our knowledge, been previously recognized. We show the interference is visible in real data. Its overall impact on phase-velocity maps is probably minor due to many measurements from shorter path lengths less prone to interference bias. However, phase-velocity maps constructed only from measurements at epicentral distances prone to interference exhibit significant noise and poor agreement with maps from measurements that include all path lengths; the issue is especially problematic for approaches that use differential travel times between nearby stations. Accounting for interference may diminish noise in measurements and improve the accuracy of images of the upper mantle.},

  abstract = {Using 10 broadband ocean bottom seismometers from the 11-month-long deployment of the Gravity Lineations Intraplate Melting Petrologic and Seismologic Expedition (GLIMPSE) passive seismic experiment located in the south central Pacific, we have estimated the seismic impulse responses from ambient seismic noise for 45 station-to- station paths. The raw impulse responses show moveout with stationto-station distance, and there is a trend of decreasing signal-to-noise ratios as the station-to-station distance increases. The decrease in signal-to-noise ratio is expected as a smaller range of azimuths of propagating surface waves will contribute constructively to the cross-correlated signal with increasing distance, although scattering may also play a role in the coherence of seismic noise at periods less than 16 sec. From these station-to-station paths, we determined group velocities for the fundamental mode Rayleigh waves of a 2-16-sec period and the second mode Rayleigh wave of a 3.5-7-sec period. We calculate phase velocities for the fundamental mode and second mode Rayleigh wave over the same period range as the group velocities by applying a time variable filter to the noise correlation function and carefully unwrapping the phase spectrum of the resulting filtered impulse responses. Within this period range, there is a transition from waves at short periods, whose energy is mostly in the water column, to waves sensitive to crustal and upper mantle structure. The phase velocities for the second mode, which have peak sensitivity in the lower crust and shallow mantle, show evidence for azimuthal anisotropy. The average phase velocities of the station-to- station paths in the east-west direction are 2\% faster than the north-south paths at the 4-7-sec period, consistent with the fast directions determined from SKS wave splitting measurements of similar to N100 degrees E. By incorporating the short-period fundamental and higher mode phase velocities from ambient seismic noise with longer period (16-100 sec) fundamental mode Rayleigh-wave phase velocities determined from teleseismic events, we inverted for the average crustal and upper mantle shear velocity structure and water column depth and velocity. The predicted phase velocities are extremely sensitive to the water column compressional velocity. We determined the average water column velocity to be 1466 +/- 3 m/sec, in contrast to the average of 1500 m/sec estimated from shipboard measurements weighted according to the Rayleigh-wave sensitivity kernel. The difference may be due to the dispersive effects of scattering by bathymetry or by the thin variable thickness sediment layer. The inversion also produces a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.88 for the crust. This method can provide useful information about the shallow seismic structure of the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle and is an important complement to longer period studies.},

Seismic imaging reveals that these plumes can be of deep origin--probably rooted on thermochemical structures in the lower mantle. Although palaeomagnetic and radiometric age data suggest that mantle flow can advect plume conduits laterally, the flow dynamics underlying the formation of the sharp bend occurring only in the Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot track in the Pacific Ocean remains enigmatic. Here we present palaeogeographically constrained numerical models of thermochemical convection and demonstrate that flow in the deep lower mantle under the north Pacific was anomalously vigorous between 100 million years ago and 50 million years ago as a consequence of long-lasting subduction systems, unlike those in the south Pacific. These models show a sharp bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot track arising from the interplay of plume tilt and the lateral advection of plume sources. The different trajectories of the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspot tracks arise from asymmetric deformation of thermochemical structures under the Pacific between 100 million years ago and 50 million years ago. This asymmetric deformation waned just before the Hawaiian-Emperor bend developed, owing to flow in the deepest lower mantle associated with slab descent in the north and south Pacific.},

In this paper, we propose an improved version of the fast marching method (FMM) that is highly accurate for both 2D and 3D Cartesian domains. The new method is called multistencils fast marching (MSFM), which computes the solution at each grid point by solving the Eikonal equation along several stencils and then picks the solution that satisfies the upwind condition. The stencils are centered at each grid point and cover its entire nearest neighbors. In 2D space, two stencils cover 8-neighbors of the point, whereas in 3D space, six stencils cover its 26-neighbors. For those stencils that are not aligned with the natural coordinate system, the Eikonal equation is derived using directional derivatives and then solved using higher order finite difference schemes. The accuracy of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art FMM-based techniques has been demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {The geographical distribution of the (1981-2005) seismicity in southern California forms a +/- 150 km broad zone adjacent to the Pacific-North America plate boundary, ranging from depths of similar to 1-similar to 30 km, with the bulk of the focal depths in the range of 2-12 km. The distribution of the seismicity that includes both mainshock-aftershock sequences and background events is affected by both static and kinematic geophysical parameters of the crust. The static parameters include heat flow, topography, crustal density, V(p)/V(s) ratio, hypocentral fault-distance and crustal thickness from receiver functions. The tectonic loading is represented by kinematic parameters such as the crustal shear strain rate field, and the dilatational strain rate field. In our analysis, we normalize the seismicity relative to the areal density of the range of values of each of the parameters. Most of the seismicity occurs in areas of average heat flow, low to intermediate topography, average V(p)/V(s) and high late Quaternary fault density, and forms seismogenic zones that extend through the brittle crust. The location of late Quaternary faults, often described as zones of weakness, influences the geographical distribution of seismicity more than any other parameter. Although above or below average crustal properties such as high heat flow, thin crust or very low V(p)/V(s) values exist, these properties only influence the spatial distribution of seismicity in a minor way. As an example, the Salton Trough area of low topography, high heat flow, high V(p)/V(s), high shear strain rate and thin crust has distributed seismicity within a thin seismogenic zone. Also, somewhat surprisingly, areas of high topography, low heat flow, low V(p)/V(s), low shear strain rate and thick crust have low seismicity rates but a thin seismogenic zone. We determine an empirical relationship between heat flow and crustal thickness to show how the similar to 400 degrees C temperature isotherm gradually deepens with crustal thickness and forms the base of the seismogenic zone for crustal thicknesses from 22 to 37 km. For crustal thickness ranging from 37 to 43 km, the similar to 250 degrees C isotherm forms the base of the seismogenic zone, suggesting that seismic faulting in these regions is confined to the top of the upper crust (12-14 km), and thus does not accommodate plate motion.},

One of the biggest challenges with these models is that exact inference is intractable. The current state-of-the-art inference method, Variational Inference (VI), employs a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. This can be a potentially poor unimodal approximation of the generally multimodal posterior. In this work, we provide evidence for the non-Gaussian nature of the posterior and we apply the Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to generate samples. To efficiently optimize the hyperparameters, we introduce the Moving Window MCEM algorithm. This results in significantly better predictions at a lower computational cost than its VI counterpart. Thus our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for inference in DGPs.},

An initial dispersion curve is automatically estimated using a heuristic approach to prevent misidentification of the phase. A second step then more accurately fits the observed noise correlation function (NCF) between interstation pairs in the frequency domain. For good quality cross correlations with reasonable signal-to-noise ratio, we are able to very accurately fit the spectrum of NCFs and hence obtain reliable estimates of both phase and group velocity jointly for Love and Rayleigh surface waves. In addition, we also show how uncertainties can be estimated with linearized approximations from the Jacobians and subsequently used in tomographic inversions.},

  abstract = {Receiver function analysis is widely used to make quantitative inferences about the structure below a seismic station. As these observables are mainly sensitive to traveltimes of phases converted and reflected at seismic discontinuities, the resulting inverse problem is highly non-linear, the solution non-unique, and there are strong trade-offs between the depth of discontinuities and absolute velocities. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to measure the misfit between the predicted and observed data with an optimal transport distance instead of the conventional least-squares distance, a strategy that has shown its assets in the context of full waveform inversion. This approach views a seismogram as a distribution of `mass'. The optimal transport distance between two waveforms is the minimal cost of transporting one waveform onto the other. We test the optimal transport approach on the inversion of a radial P-wave receiver function. We also show how it can be applied to measure the cross-convolution distance between the radial and vertical components, thus avoiding the need for deconvolution associated with the calculation of the receiver function. The resulting misfit function is minimized with a local optimization algorithm to constrain the receiver-side structure. The benefits of this methodology are studied in simple synthetic tests and with real data. In particular, we show that with its increased sensibility to time-shifts, the optimal transport distance reduces the number of local minima in the misfit function, which, in the case of a linearized inversion, significantly reduces the dependency to the starting model and results in a better convergence towards the solution model. A joint inversion of the P-wave receiver function and surface wave dispersion curves is performed at the Hyderabad station in India.},

Here this influential work is revisited and rederived in a more straightforward manner. Our derivation is based on computing the time to instability for a population of sources, and eschews the seismicity state variable. We demonstrate the validity of the Dieterich (1994) model for arbitrary shear stressing history at constant normal stress; however, our results differ slightly if fault normal stress changes with time. We provide simple integral expressions for the cumulative number of events and seismicity rate for arbitrary stressing history. These expressions have no explicit dependence on the time derivative of the stressing history. The simpler derivation makes it easier to assess and generalize various model assumptions in the original formulation. A principal success of the Dieterich (1994) theory is that it predicts and gives physical meaning to the Omori decay of seismicity rate following a stress step. We analyze the assumption that sources are well above steady state and find that Omori decay is produced by sources that either start or end up above steady state following the stress step. If no sources are brought above steady state by the perturbation then the time to reach steady state must be considered, and there will be no Omori sequence.},

Recently, a phase transition from perovskite to postperovskite was discovered through a significant change in the X-ray diffraction pattern at high-pressure and high-temperature conditions corresponding to the core-mantle boundary region. This phase transition was also confirmed by first-principles calculations. These suggest that (Mg, Fe) SiO3 postperovskite is the predominant mineral in the lowermost mantle called the D" layer, and phase transition from perovskite to postperovskite has significant geophysical implications for its nature and dynamics. The postperovskite phase may account for the large seismic anomalies observed in the D" region, such as the D" discontinuity, S wave anisotropy, and anticorrelation between the anomalies in S wave and bulk sound velocities. In addition, this phase transition is a strongly exothermic reaction. It destabilizes the thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle and should promote the formation of high-temperature upwelling plumes.},

Clear inner core phases PKIKP2 and PKIIKP2 are observed across the entire array. Spatial analysis of the differential travel time residuals between the two phases reveals significant short-wavelength variation and implies the existence of strong structural variability in the deep Earth.

The possible depth and dimension of a slab break were also investigated through synthetic tests of whether the slab had torn.

  abstract = {We develop a model for phase separation in magma reservoirs containing a mixture of silicate melt, crystals, and fluids (exsolved volatiles). The interplay between the three phases controls the dynamics of phase separation and consequently the chemical and physical evolution of magma reservoirs. The model we propose is based on the two-phase damage theory approach of Bercovici et al. (2001, https://doi.org/10.1029/2000JB900430) and Bercovici and Ricard (2003, https://doi.org/10.1046/ j.1365-246X.2003.01854.x) because it offers the leverage of considering interface (in the macroscopic limit) between phases that can deform depending on the mechanical work and phase changes taking place locally in the magma. Damage models also offer the advantage that pressure is defined uniquely to each phase and does not need to be equal among phases, which will enable us to consider, in future studies, the large capillary pressure at which fluids are mobilized in mature, crystal-rich, magma bodies. In this first analysis of three-phase compaction, we solve the three-phase compaction equations numerically for a simple 1-D problem where we focus on the effect of fluids on the efficiency of melt-crystal separation considering the competition between viscous and buoyancy stresses only. We contrast three sets of simulations to explore the behavior of three-phase compaction, a melt-crystal reference compaction scenario (two-phase compaction), a three-phase scenario without phase changes, and finally a three-phase scenario with a parameterized second boiling (crystallization-induced exsolution). The simulations show a dramatic difference between two-phase (melt crystals) and three-phase (melt-crystals-exsolved volatiles) compaction-driven phase separation. We find that the presence of a lighter, significantly less viscous fluid hinders melt-crystal separation.},

This catalog consists of phase picks, hypocenters, and magnitudes. We present the history of the SCSN and the evolution of the catalog, to facilitate user understanding of its limitations and strengths. Hypocenters and magnitudes have improved in quality with time, as the number of stations has increased gradually from 7 to similar to 400 and the data acquisition and measuring procedures have become more sophisticated. The magnitude of completeness (M-c) of the network has improved from M-c similar to 3.25 in the early years to M-c similar to 1.8 at present, or better in the most densely instrumented areas. Mainshock-aftershock and swarm sequences and scattered individual background earthquakes characterize the seismicity of more than 470,000 events. The earthquake frequency-size distribution has an average b-value of similar to 1.0, with M {$>$}= 6.0 events occurring approximately every 3 yrs. The three largest earthquakes recorded were 1952 M-w 7.5 Kern County, 1992 M-w 7.3 Landers, and 1999 M-w 7.1 Hector Mine sequences, and the three most damaging earthquakes were the 1933 M-w 6.4 Long Beach, 1971 M-w 6.7 San Fernando, and 1994 M-w 6.7 Northridge earthquakes. All of these events ruptured slow-slipping faults, located away from the main plate boundary fault, the San Andreas fault. Their aftershock sequences constitute about a third of the events in the catalog. The fast slipping southern San Andreas fault is relatively quiet at the microseismic level and has not had an M {$>$} 6 earthquake since 1932. In contrast, the slower San Jacinto fault has the highest level of seismicity, including several M {$>$} 6 events. Thus, the spatial and temporal seismicity patterns exhibit a complex relationship with the plate tectonic crustal deformation.},

Here we present the results of DAS observations from a submarine cable offshore Cape Muroto, Nankai subduction zone, western Japan. The observed signal amplitude varies widely among the DAS channels, even over short distances of only\,\textasciitilde\,100 m, which is likely attributed to the differences in cable-seafloor coupling due to complex bathymetry along the cable route. Nevertheless, the noise levels at the well-coupled channels of DAS are almost comparable to those observed at nearby permanent ocean-bottom seismometers, suggesting that the cable has the ability to detect nearby micro earthquakes and even tectonic tremors. Many earthquakes were observed during the 5-day observation period, with the minimum and maximum detectable events being a local M1.1 event 30\textendash 50 km from the cable and a teleseismic Mw7.7 event that occurred in Cuba, respectively. Temperature appears to exert a greater control on the DAS signal than real strain in the quasi-static, sub-seismic range, where we can regard our DAS record as distributed temperature sensing (DTS) record, and detected many rapid temperature change events migrating along the cable: a small number of large migration events (up to 10 km in 6 h) associated with rapid temperature decreases, and many small-scale events (both rising and falling temperatures). These events may reflect oceanic internal surface waves and deep-ocean water mixing processes that are the result of ocean current\textendash tidal interactions along an irregular seafloor boundary.},

Res. 99 10143\textendash 62) as a novel method for data assimilation: state estimation for noisily observed time-dependent problems. Since that time it has had enormous impact in many application domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation, and numerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of an iterative ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse problems. In this context we show that the estimate of the unknown function that we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a subspace A spanned by the initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the error found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical experiments which compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems with the error of the best approximation in A, and with variants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted to the subspace A. In so doing we demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems provides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that achieved by traditional least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order of magnitude as that achieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate these assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of piezometric head to determine hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of groundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity measurements at positive times to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian framework is the standard approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling. This framework involves characterizing the posterior distribution of geological parameters in terms of a given prior distribution and data from the reservoir dynamics, together with a forward model connecting the space of geological parameters to the data space. Since the posterior distribution quantifies the uncertainty in the geologic parameters of the reservoir, the characterization of the posterior is fundamental for the optimal management of reservoirs. Unfortunately, due to the large-scale highly nonlinear properties of standard reservoir models, characterizing the posterior is computationally prohibitive. Instead, more affordable ad hoc techniques, based on Gaussian approximations, are often used for characterizing the posterior distribution. Evaluating the performance of those Gaussian approximations is typically conducted by assessing their ability at reproducing the truth within the confidence interval provided by the ad hoc technique under consideration. This has the disadvantage of mixing up the approximation properties of the history matching algorithm employed with the information content of the particular observations used, making it hard to evaluate the effect of the ad hoc approximations alone. In this paper, we avoid this disadvantage by comparing the ad hoc techniques with a fully resolved state-of-the-art probing of the Bayesian posterior distribution. The ad hoc techniques whose performance we assess are based on (1) linearization around the maximum a posteriori estimate, (2) randomized maximum likelihood, and (3) ensemble Kalman filter-type methods. In order to fully resolve the posterior distribution, we implement a state-of-the art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that scales well with respect to the dimension of the parameter space, enabling us to study realistic forward models, in two space dimensions, at a high level of grid refinement. Our implementation of the MCMC method provides the gold standard against which the aforementioned Gaussian approximations are assessed. We present numerical synthetic experiments where we quantify the capability of each of the ad hoc Gaussian approximation in reproducing the mean and the variance of the posterior distribution (characterized via MCMC) associated to a data assimilation problem. Both single-phase and two-phase (oil-water) reservoir models are considered so that fundamental differences in the resulting forward operators are highlighted. The main objective of our controlled experiments was to exhibit the substantial discrepancies of the approximation properties of standard ad hoc Gaussian approximations. Numerical investigations of the type we present here will lead to the greater understanding of the cost-efficient, but ad hoc, Bayesian techniques used for data assimilation in petroleum reservoirs and hence ultimately to improved techniques with more accurate uncertainty quantification.},

  abstract = {We propose the application of iterative regularization for the development of ensemble methods for solving Bayesian inverse problems. In concrete, we construct (i) a variational iterative regularizing ensemble Levenberg-Marquardt method (IR-enLM) and (ii) a derivative-free iterative ensemble Kalman smoother (IR-ES). The aim of these methods is to provide a robust ensemble approximation of the Bayesian posterior. The proposed methods are based on fundamental ideas from iterative regularization methods that have been widely used for the solution of deterministic inverse problems [21]. In this work we are interested in the application of the proposed ensemble methods for the solution of Bayesian inverse problems that arise in reservoir modeling applications. The proposed ensemble methods use key aspects of the regularizing Levenberg-Marquardt scheme developed by Hanke [16] and that we recently applied for history matching in [18]. In the case where the forward operator is linear and the prior is Gaussian, we show that the proposed IR-enLM and IR-ES coincide with standard randomized maximum likelihood (RML) and the ensemble smoother (ES) respectively. For the general nonlinear case, we develop a numerical framework to assess the performance of the proposed ensemble methods at capturing the posterior. This framework consists of using a state-of-the art MCMC method for resolving the Bayesian posterior from synthetic experiments. The resolved posterior via MCMC then provides a gold standard against to which compare the proposed IR-enLM and IR-ES. We show that for the careful selection of regularization parameters, robust approximations of the posterior can be accomplished in terms of mean and variance. Our numerical experiments showcase the advantage of using iterative regularization for obtaining more robust and stable approximation of the posterior than standard unregularized methods.},

  abstract = {We introduce a derivative-free computational framework for approximating solutions to nonlinear PDE-constrained inverse problems. The general aim is to merge ideas from iterative regularization with ensemble Kalman methods from Bayesian inference to develop a derivative-free stable method easy to implement in applications where the PDE (forward) model is only accessible as a black box (e.g. with commercial software). The proposed regularizing ensemble Kalman method can be derived as an approximation of the regularizing Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) scheme [14] in which the derivative of the forward operator and its adjoint are replaced with empirical covariances from an ensemble of elements from the admissible space of solutions. The resulting ensemble method consists of an update formula that is applied to each ensemble member and that has a regularization parameter selected in a similar fashion to the one in the LM scheme. Moreover, an early termination of the scheme is proposed according to a discrepancy principle-type of criterion. The proposed method can be also viewed as a regularizing version of standard Kalman approaches which are often unstable unless ad-hoc fixes, such as covariance localization, are implemented.},

Deep earthquakes, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a ductile fault zone matrix.},

Such an interpretation implies that significant transform motion did not occur on the southern San Andreas fault prior to 6 Ma and that the Gulf of California has opened primarily since 6 Ma. We propose a three-stage model for evolution of the Los Angeles basin and vicinity within the evolving transform-fault system: transrotation (18\textendash 12 Ma), transtension (12\textendash 6 Ma), and transpression (6\textendash 0 Ma).

However, it remains unclear if division of the inner core into just two hemispheres is too simplistic. Here, we carry out regional-scale tomography using a new body wave data set to study the hemisphere boundary region beneath the northern and central Pacific Ocean and North America. If anisotropy is not considered, then a hemispherical pattern seems to be present in the study region, though the hemisphere boundary appears to be irregular. However, once the presence of anisotropy is permitted we find that this region cannot be simply separated into an anisotropic western hemisphere and an isotropic eastern hemisphere; instead the strength of the anisotropy varies regionally. The global hemispherical pattern is not observed here, instead the strongest anisotropy is observed in the centre and south west of the study region. Some of the strongest anisotropy appears to be in the `eastern' inner core, while part of the inner core assumed to be in the western hemisphere shows weaker anisotropy. Thus, this part of the inner core displays complex variations in anisotropy which differ from a simple hemispherical division. We suggest that a long-lived global heterogeneity, such as uneven heat flow through the core\textendash mantle boundary over a period of hundreds of millions of years, may be responsible for the observed pattern of inner core anisotropy.},

  abstract = {We propose a fast local level set method for the inverse problem of gravimetry. The theoretical foundation for our approach is based on the following uniqueness result: if an open set D is star-shaped or x3-convex with respect to its center of gravity, then its exterior potential uniquely determines the open set D. To achieve this purpose constructively, the first challenge is how to parametrize this open set D as its boundary may have a variety of possible shapes. To describe those different shapes we propose to use a level-set function to parametrize the unknown boundary of this open set. The second challenge is how to deal with the issue of partial data as gravimetric measurements are only made on a part of a given reference domain {$\Omega$}. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a linear numerical continuation approach based on the single layer representation to find potentials on the boundary of some artificial domain containing the unknown set D. The third challenge is how to speed up the level set inversion process. Based on some features of the underlying inverse gravimetry problem such as the potential density being constant inside the unknown domain, we propose a novel numerical approach which is able to take advantage of these features so that the computational speed is accelerated by an order of magnitude. We carry out numerical experiments for both two- and three-dimensional cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm.},

  abstract = {Understanding the subduction processes along the Sunda Trench requires detailed constraints on the subducting lithosphere. We build a detailed tectonic map of the Wharton Basin based on reinterpretation of satellite-derived gravity anomalies and marine magnetic anomalies. The Wharton Basin is characterized by a fossil ridge, dated similar to 36.5Ma, offset by N-S fracture zones. Magnetic anomalies 18 to 34 (38-84Ma) are identified on both flanks, although a large part of the basin has been subducted. We analyze the past plate kinematic evolution of the Wharton Basin by two-plate (India-Australia) and three-plate (India-Australia-Antarctica) reconstructions. Despite the diffuse plate boundaries within the Indo-Australian plate for the last 20Ma, we obtain finite rotation parameters that we apply to reconstruct the subducted Wharton Basin and constrain the thickness, buoyancy, and rheology of the subducting plate. The lower subductability of younger lithosphere off Sumatra has important consequences on the morphology, with a shallower trench, forearc islands, and a significant inward deviation of the subduction system. This deviation decreases in the youngest area, where the Wharton fossil spreading center enters subduction: The discontinuous magmatic crust and serpentinized upper mantle, consequences of the slow spreading rates at which this area was formed, weaken the mechanical resistance to subduction and facilitate the restoration of the accretionary prism. Deeper effects include the possible creation of asthenospheric windows beneath the Andaman Sea, in relation to the long-offset fracture zones, and east of 105 degrees E, as a result of subduction of the spreading center.

Existing sediment models of the LA Basin are generally derived from sonic logs and industry reflection profiles, but these models are limited by spatial coverage of well sites and seismic lines. There have been several dense seismic arrays deployed by oil companies that can be used to determine the shallow velocity structure with ambient noise cross correlations. In this study, we show cross-correlations between five dense arrays and 21 continuous broadband stations of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) in LA Basin. Each SCSN station is regarded as a virtual source, and all dense array stations are receivers. We observed clear fundamental and higher mode Rayleigh waves of 0.2 2.0 Hz from the noise correlation functions. Surface waves in this frequency range are sensitive to structure of depth less than 2 km, and their rays cover a large portion of LA Basin. However, Rayleigh wave dispersion curves show modal complexity and make automatic identification of particular mode branches challenging. We measured Rayleigh wave group velocities by fitting the peaks in frequency-time analysis, and retrieve shear-wave velocity structure with seismic tomography.},

  abstract = {Pseudotachylites are melts produced by frictional heating during seismic slip. Understanding their origin and their influence on slip behavior is critical to understanding the physics of earthquakes. To provide insight into this topic, we conducted a case study in the proto-mylonitic to mylonitic Asbestos Mountain granitoid in the eastern Peninsular Ranges batholith (California), which records both ductile (mylonites) and brittle deformation features (pseudotachylites and ultracataclasites). U-Pb chronology and Zr thermometry of titanite porphyroblasts in the mylonites indicate that mylonitization of the plutons occurred at near solidus conditions (similar to 750 degrees C) over a 10 Ma interval from 89 to 78 Ma. Mylonitization resulted in recrystallization of quartz, plagioclase and biotite, with the biotite concentrated into biotite-rich foliation planes. Subsequent brittle deformation is superimposed on the ductile fabrics. Micro-XRF elemental mapping and in situ LA-ICP-MS analyses on these brittle deformation products show that the pseudotachylites are more mafic (lower Si, but higher Fe) and K-rich than the host mylonite, while the ultracataclasites are intermediate between the host and the pseudotachylites. Inverse mass balance calculations show that both brittle deformation products are depleted in quartz but enriched in biotite, with the pseudotachylites showing the most significant enrichment in biotite, indicating preferential involvement of biotite during brittle deformation. We suggest that biotite-rich layers generated during ductile deformation may have been the preferred locus of subsequent brittle deformation, presumably because such layers represent zones of weakness. Frictional heating associated with slip along such planes results in melting, which causes a decrease in viscosity, in turn leading to further strain localization. During the short time span of an earthquake, frictional melting appears to be a disequilibrium process, in which the minerals are melted in order of their melting points, from biotite (similar to 800 degrees C) to plagioclase (similar to 1400 degrees C) and finally to quartz (similar to 1700 degrees C), rather than by equilibrium melting, which results in silicic eutectoid melts at lower temperatures (similar to 650 degrees C). Thus, with progressive slip, melt composition should evolve from mafic to felsic, eventually approaching the bulk composition of the host rock. The mafic composition of the pseudotachylites thus indicates that they formed between the melting point of biotite and plagioclase (800-4400 degrees C). Our chemical and modeling analyses on the pseudotachylites suggest that the chemical composition of pseudotachylites can potentially be used to constrain the thermodynamic conditions in the shear zone as well as earthquake source mechanics.

  abstract = {We have developed a new method to retrieve seismic surface wave phase velocity using dense seismic arrays. The method measures phase variations between nearby stations based on waveform cross-correlation. The coherence in waveforms between adjacent stations results in highly precise relative phase estimates. Frequency-dependent phase variations are then inverted for spatial variations in apparent phase velocity via the Eikonal equation. Frequency-dependent surface wave amplitudes measured on individual stations are used to correct the apparent phase velocity to account for multipathing via the Helmholtz equation. By using coherence and other data selection criteria, we construct an automated system that retrieves structural phase-velocity maps directly from raw seismic waveforms for individual earthquakes without human intervention. The system is applied to broad-band seismic data from over 800 events recorded on EarthScope's USArray from 2006 to 2014, systematically building up Rayleigh-wave phase-velocity maps between the periods of 20 and 100 s for the entire continental United States. At the highest frequencies, the resulting maps are highly correlated with phase-velocity maps derived from ambient noise tomography. At all frequencies, we observe a significant contrast in Rayleigh-wave phase velocity between the tectonically active western US and the stable eastern US, with the phase velocity variations in the western US being 1-2 times greater. The Love wave phase-velocity maps are also calculated. We find that overtone contamination may produce systemic bias for the Love-wave phase-velocity measurements.},

  abstract = {Paleomagnetic studies place much of the Cordilleran orogen v3000 km south, relative to autochthonous North America at 85 Ma. This conflicts with geological studies which have been interpreted to indicate minor displacement. The inability to reconcile these interpretations has precluded understanding the tectonic development of the Cordillera, and has cast doubt on global paleogeographic reconstructions which rely upon paleomagnetic studies. I demonstrate that Alaska and Yukon are divisible into a series of geological belts, including the northerly east\^west-trending Arctic Alaska, the central southwest-trending Ruby, the southerly east-trending Dillinger and the southeast-trending Yukon\^ Tanana belts. Each belt is characterized by four regularly arranged rock sequences; (1) a Paleozoic continental margin strata, (2) a Devonian\^Mississippian arc assemblage, (3) an ophiolite, and (4) an Early to mid-Cretaceous arc. These correlations greatly simplify the terrane nomenclature of the northern Cordillera and provide a basis for a new palinspastic reconstruction of the Cordillera. Continuity of the belts can be demonstrated through connecting oroclines, and facing a structural vergence directions vary in a consistent and predictable fashion indicating that the belts previously formed part of a linear ribbon continent. This ribbon continent, referred to here as SAYBIA, originally extended south from eastern Siberia and was V8000 km long. Northward translation in response to coupling with the Kula plate was accommodated by buckling (oroclinal orogeny) of SAYBIA, much like a derailing train, with scissored `cars' forming much of Alaska. Oroclinal orogeny makes consistent interpretations of available geological and paleomagnetic data in the Cordillera, provides a means for the rapid construction of continent, and may have been an important process involved in the construction of ancient continental nuclei. \ss{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

As the aftershocks decay with time, the probability that an earthquake will be a foreshock increases. However, fault interactions between the first mainshock and the major fault can increase the long-term probability of a characteristic earthquake on that fault, which will, in turn, increase the probability that an event is a foreshock, compensating for the decrease caused by the aftershocks.},

A recent workflow efficiently utilized both machines to generate 285 million two-component seismograms for the central California region from which 46 billion intensity measurements were extracted. We summarize the current suite of CyberShake models and apply averagingbased factorization (ABF) to decompose each model into a hierarchy of site, path, directivity, stress-drop, and source complexity effects. We summarize how the strength of the directivity effect decreases with increasing source complexity, and how the site and path effects vary with differences in crustal structure. Comparisons quantified by the ABF variances indicate that simulation-based hazard models can potentially reduce \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend ", the total unexplained variability in current ground-motion prediction equations, by as much as one-third.},

  abstract = {Seismic full-waveform inversion tries to estimate subsurface medium parameters from seismic data. Areas with subsurface salt bodies are of particular interest because they often have hydrocarbon reservoirs on their sides or underneath. Accurate reconstruction of their geometry is a challenge for current techniques. This paper presents a parametric level-set method for the reconstruction of salt-bodies in seismic full-waveform inversion. We split the subsurface model in two parts: a background velocity model and a salt body with known velocity but undetermined shape. The salt geometry is represented by a level-set function that evolves during the inversion. We choose radial basis functions to represent the level-set function, leading to an optimization problem with a modest number of parameters. A common problem with level-set methods is to fine-tune the width of the level-set boundary for optimal sensitivity. We propose a robust algorithm that dynamically adapts the width of the level-set boundary to ensure faster convergence. Tests on a suite of idealized salt geometries show that the proposed method is stable against a modest amount of noise. We also extend the method to joint inversion of both the background velocity model and the salt geometry.},

  abstract = {Earthquakes occur as a result of global plate motion. However, this simple picture is far from complete. Some plate boundaries glide past each other smoothly, while others are punctuated by catastrophic failures. Some earthquakes stop after only a few hundred metres while others continue rupturing for a thousand kilometres. Earthquakes are sometimes triggered by other large earthquakes thousands of kilometres away. We address these questions by dissecting the observable phenomena and separating out the quantifiable features for comparison across events. We begin with a discussion of stress in the crust followed by an overview of earthquake phenomenology, focusing on the parameters that are readily measured by current seismic techniques. We briefly discuss how these parameters are related to the amplitude and frequencies of the elastic waves measured by seismometers as well as direct geodetic measurements of the Earth's deformation. We then review the major processes thought to be active during the rupture and discuss their relation to the observable parameters. We then take a longer range view by discussing how earthquakes interact as a complex system. Finally, we combine subjects to approach the key issue of earthquake initiation. This concluding discussion will require using the processes introduced in the study of rupture as well as some novel mechanisms. As our observational database improves, our computational ability accelerates and our laboratories become more refined, the next few decades promise to bring more insights on earthquakes and perhaps some answers.},

However, the necessity of using large training data and the `black box' nature of learning have limited them in practice and difficult to interpret. Furthermore, including the governing equations and physical facts in such methods is also another challenge, which entails either ignoring the physics or simplifying them using unrealistic data. To address such issues, physics informed machine learning methods have been developed which can integrate the governing physics law into the learning process. In this work, a 1dimensional (1D) time-dependent seismic wave equation is considered and solved using two methods, namely Gaussian process (GP) and physics informed neural networks. We show that these meshless methods are trained by smaller amount of data and can predict the solution of the equation with even high accuracy. They are also capable of inverting any parameter involved in the governing equation such as wave velocity in our case. Results show that the GP can predict the solution of the seismic wave equation with a lower level of error, while our developed neural network is more accurate for velocity (P- and S-wave) and density inversion.},

  abstract = {Oceanic plates subducted at trenches penetrate into the deep mantle, and encounter a structural boundary at a depth of 410 km where olivine, the dominant element of mantle rocks, transforms into a higher density form wadsleyite. This transformation may be delayed within the coldest core of subducting plates (slabs) due to kinetic effects, and it has been suggested that metastable olivine may persist deeper than 410 km. Using high density seismic array data in Japan, we show the direct image of the structure corresponding to this metastable olivine wedge (MOW) beneath southwest Japan. Numerical simulation of a subducting slab, including the kinetic effect of water (H2O) on the olivine wadsleyite transformation, indicates that the presence of the imaged MOW requires an insignificant amount of water (less than 100 wt. ppm) be present in the slab mantle, thus a deep dry cold slab. We infer that the transportation of water into the deep mantle occurs along the top surface of the subducting slab, but no significant amount within the slab itself. We also demonstrate that a numerical simulation including the kinetics of 660-km phase transformation can reconcile the observed deep depression of the 660-km discontinuity with a gentle Clapeyron slope.

The interval from 3 to 10\,h after the onset of major earthquakes is employed for the period range from 15 to 50\,s. The observations can be well matched by synthetic seismograms for a radially stratified Earth. Many of the correlation phases have similar time behaviour to those in the regular wavefield, but others have no correspondence. All such correlation phases can be explained by the interaction of arrivals with a common slowness at the each of the stations being correlated. Using a generalized ray description of the seismic wavefield, the time-distance behaviour of these correlation phases arises from differences in accumulated phase on different propagation paths through the Earth. Distinct arrivals emerge from the correlation field when there are many ways in which combinations of seismic phases can arise with the same difference in propagation legs. The constituents of the late coda are dominated by steeply travelling waves, and in consequence features associated with multiple passages through the whole Earth emerge distinctly, such as high-order multiples of               PKIKP               .},

Particularly, we propose a novel loss function that relies on the variational (integral) form of PDEs as apposed to their differential form which is commonly used in the literature. Our loss function is discretization-free, highly parallelizable, and more effective in capturing the solution of PDEs since it employs lowerorder derivatives and trains over measure non-zero regions of space-time. Given this loss function, we also propose an approach to optimally select the space-time samples, used to train the NN, that is based on the feedback provided from the PDE residual. The models obtained using VarNet are smooth and do not require interpolation. They are also easily differentiable and can directly be used for control and optimization of PDEs. Finally, VarNet can straight-forwardly incorporate parametric PDE models making it a natural tool for model order reduction (MOR) of PDEs. We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive numerical experiments for the advection-diffusion PDE as an important case-study.},

We used a manifold learning algorithm called ``the Sequencer'' to simultaneously analyze thousands of seismograms of waves diffracting along the core-mantle boundary and obtain a panoptic view of scattering across the Pacific region. In nearly half of the diffracting waveforms, we detected seismic waves scattered by three-dimensional structures near the core-mantle boundary. The prevalence of these scattered arrivals shows that the region hosts pervasive lateral heterogeneity. Our analysis revealed loud signals due to a plume root beneath Hawaii and a previously unrecognized ultralow-velocity zone beneath the Marquesas Islands. These observations illustrate how approaches flexible enough to detect robust patterns with little to no user supervision can reveal distinctive insights into the deep Earth.},

However, reports of pseudotachylytes are rare compared to the frequency and distribution of earthquakes in active faults, suggesting melting occurs only under exceptional circumstances and therefore that pseudotachylytes are rarely formed. In this paper, we document the processes whereby pseudotachylytes are overprinted, destroyed and otherwise removed from the rock record. We present examples of recrystallized, altered, and cataclastically and crystal plastically deformed pseudotachylytes from a variety of ancient faults. Based on these observations, we identify characteristics of pseudotachylytes that are resistant to change over geologic time and develop criteria to allow recognition of relict pseudotachylytes. Our results imply that pseudotachylytes are vastly under-reported due to their vulnerability to destruction and the resulting difficulty in identification. As a consequence, the significance of frictional melting is underestimated. The criteria we propose to distinguish relict pseudotachylytes can help to reconcile the observed frequency of earthquakes with the difficulty of demonstrating ancient seismic slip in the rock record.

The method was developed following the magnitude 9.2 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in 2004. Although properties of earthquakes have been investigated using array data prior to the introduction of the back-projection method, this technique differs from other approaches because it makes limited assumptions and allows detailed and complex rupture propagation to be examined. These advantages have led several researchers to apply the method to many of the largest earthquakes to occur this century. The method has also been effective for the detection of smaller events. A critical component of the success of back-projection has been the development of large-scale, dense seismic arrays. Further improvements and future applications of the method will depend greatly on the continued maintenance and development of these networks.},

  abstract = {Lower mantle tomography models consistently feature an increase in the ratio of shear-wave velocity (V S ) to compressional-wave velocity (V P ) variations and a negative correlation between shear-wave and bulk-sound velocity (V C ) variations. These seismic characteristics, also observed in the recent SP12RTS model, have been interpreted to be indicative of large-scale chemical variations. Other explanations, such as the lower mantle post-perovskite (pPv) phase, which would not require chemical heterogeneity, have been explored less. Constraining the origin of these seismic features is important, as geodynamic simulations predict a fundamentally different style of mantle convection under both scenarios. Here, we investigate to what extent the presence of pPv explains the observed high V S /V P ratios and negative V S \textendash V C correlation globally. We compare the statistical properties of SP12RTS with the statistics of synthetic tomography models, derived from both thermal and thermochemical models of 3-D global mantle convection. We convert the temperature fields of these models into seismic velocity structures using mineral physics lookup tables with and without pPv. We account for the limited tomographic resolution of SP12RTS using its resolution operator for both V S and V P structures. This allows for direct comparisons of the resulting velocity ratios and correlations. Although the tomographic filtering significantly affects the synthetic tomography images, we demonstrate that the effect of pPv remains evident in the ratios and correlations of seismic velocities. We find that lateral variations in the presence of pPv have a dominant influence on the V S /V P ratio and V S \textendash V C correlation, which are thus unsuitable measures to constrain the presence of large-scale chemical variations in the lowermost mantle. To explain the decrease in the V S /V P ratio of SP12RTS close to the CMB, our results favour a pPv-bearing CMB region, which has implications for the stability field of pPv in the Earth's mantle.},

  abstract = {The coremantle boundary (CMB) is Earths most profound internal boundary separating the liquid iron outer core and the solid silicate mantle. The detailed structure near the CMB has a major influence on mantle convection and the evolution of the core. Seismic observations, such as topography on the CMB, thin ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs), seismic anisotropy and the anticorrelation between shear wave and bulk sound velocity heterogeneities have mainly been made using body waves and are still poorly constrained. We investigate the sensitivity of Earths free oscillations to these features and specifically show how large individual anomalies must be for them to be observable. In addition, we discuss the possible trade-offs between these different lowermost mantle structures. Although modes have strong sensitivity to all the structures inserted, the results illustrate the limits of what normal modes can resolve. Our tests show that: (i) Even small scale features, such as ULVZs, with a thickness larger than 19 km can be observed as long as their distribution contains a long wavelength component. (ii) The peak-to-peak amplitude of CMB topography has a larger influence than its pattern and has to be smaller than 5 km to fit the data. (iii) The effect of scaling between shear wave velocity and density anomalies is less constrained, but a laterally varying pattern is implied by a simple test, suggesting the presence of chemical variations. (iv) A strong trade-off exists between anisotropy in compressional wave velocity and incidence angle whereas shear wave anisotropy is less observable. These findings provide valuable information for future normal mode studies on structures in Earths lowermost mantle and their trade-offs.},

  abstract = {The populace of Los Angeles, California, was startled by shaking from the M 7.1 earthquake that struck the city of Ridgecrest located 200 km to the north on 6 July 2019. Although the earthquake did not cause damage in Los Angeles, the experience in high-rise buildings was frightening in contrast to the shaking felt in short buildings. Observations from 560 ground-level accelerometers reveal large variations in shaking in the Los Angeles basin that occurred for more than 2 min. The observations come from the spatially dense Community Seismic Network (CSN), combined with the sparser Southern California Seismic Network and California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program networks. Site amplification factors for periods of 1, 3, 6, and 8 s are computed as the ratio of each station's response spectral values combined for the two horizontal directions, relative to the average of three bedrock sites. Spatially coherent behavior in site amplification emerges for periods {$\geq$} 3 s, and the maximum calculated site amplifications are the largest, by factors of 7, 10, and 8, respectively, for 3, 6, and 8 s periods. The dense CSN observations show that the long-period amplification is clearly, but only partially, correlated with the depth to basement. Sites with the largest amplifications for the long periods ({$\geq$} 3 s) are not close to the deepest portion of the basin. At 6 and 8 s periods, the maximum amplifications occur in the western part of the Los Angeles basin and in the south-central San Fernando Valley sedimentary basin. The observations suggest that the excitation of a hypothetical high-rise located in an area characterized by the largest site amplifications could be four times larger than in a downtown Los Angeles location.},

In addition to travel time anomalies, the multipathing of S and ScS phases at different distances are used to constrain the HVSL model. We jointly invert S and ScS traveltimes, amplitudes, and waveform complexities to produce a best fitting block model characterized by a rectangular shape with a 2.5\% S wave velocity increase and tapered edges.

The method is based on a reordering of the time loop of timedomain forward/adjoint wave propagation solvers combined with the use of a memory buffer. It avoids instabilities that occur when time-reversing dissipative wave propagation simulations. The total number of required time steps is unchanged compared to usual acoustic or elastic approaches. The cost is reduced by a factor of 4/3 compared to the case in which anelasticity is partially accounted for by accommodating the effects of physical dispersion. We validate our technique by performing a test in which we compare the K{$\alpha$} sensitivity kernel to the exact kernel obtained by saving the entire forward calculation. This benchmark confirms that our approach is also exact. We illustrate the importance of including full attenuation in the calculation of sensitivity kernels by showing significant differences with physical-dispersion-only kernels.},

The best estimate of economically recoverable oil in the federal portion of ANWR is 7.06 billion barrels of oil, a quantity roughly equal to US consumption in 2005. The oil is worth \$374 billion (\$2005), but would cost \$123 billion to extract and bring to market. The difference, \$251 billion, would generate social benefits through industry rents of \$90 billion as well as state and federal tax revenues of \$37 billion and \$124 billion, respectively. A contribution of the paper is the decomposition of the benefits between industry rents and tax revenue for a range of price and quantity scenarios. But drilling and development in ANWR would also bring about environmental costs. These costs would consist largely of lost nonuse values for the protected status of ANWR's natural environment. Rather than estimate these costs and conduct a benefit\textendash cost analysis, we calculate the costs that would generate a breakeven result. We find that the average breakeven willingness to accept compensation to allow drilling in ANWR ranges from \$582 to \$1782 per person, with a mean estimate of \$1141. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Applications of our approach include offline and online supervised learning with deep neural networks, as well as graph-based semi-supervised learning. The essence of the EKI procedure is an ensemble based approximate gradient descent in which derivatives are replaced by differences from within the ensemble.

  abstract = {In this study, we propose a data-driven method using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) to select the most suitable earthquake ground motion model (GMM) for application in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). The standard deviation (sigma) of the GMM is an important parameter for PSHA and plays an important role in data-driven methods. The main advantage of the proposed procedure is to introduce the posterior sigma as the key quantity for objectively ranking different candidate models against a given earthquake ground motion dataset. In the context of the Bayesian statistical framework, sigma is then determined for a given GMM based on the observed ground motions and at the same time takes into account the misfit of the GMM predictions to the observed ground motions. This feature addresses issues associated with other ranking methods where in some cases a considerable bias between the GMM predictions and the observed ground motions is effectively ignored. On the contrary, the DIC considers the influence of these two factors together by ranking models more favorably when they are associated with smaller bias and the determined sigma is close to the actual variability of the ground motions in the region under study. We submit the DIC method of this study as a useful and objective method for evaluating the performance of a GMM to a given dataset. This has potentially important application for PSHA when using multiple GMMs and either logic tree or backbone approaches are required to handle epistemic uncertainty in an appropriate manner.},

We implement this technique to investigate the upper-mantle structure beneath Eurasia and present a new model of shear wave velocity, parametrized laterally using spherical splines with similar to 2.9 degrees spacing in Eurasia and similar to 11.5 degrees spacing elsewhere. The model is obtained from a combined data set of surface wave phase velocities, long-period waveforms and body-wave traveltimes. We identify many features as narrow as few hundred kilometres in diameter, such as subducting slabs in eastern Eurasia and slow-velocity anomalies beneath tectonically active regions. In contrast to regional studies in which these features have been identified, our model encompasses the structure of the entire Eurasian continent. Furthermore, including mantle- and body-wave waveforms helped us constrain structures at depths larger than 250 km, which are poorly resolved in earlier models. We find that up to +9 per cent faster-than-average anomalies within the uppermost similar to 200 km of the mantle beneath cratons and some orogenic regions are separated by a sharp gradient zone from deeper, +1 to +2 per cent anomalies. We speculate that this gradient zone may represent a boundary separating the lithosphere from the continental root, which might be compositionally distinct from the overlying lithosphere and remain stable either due to its compositional buoyancy or due to higher viscosity compared with the suboceanic mantle. Our regional model of anisotropy is not significantly different from the global one.},

  abstract = {Ground motions in the Los Angeles Basin during a potential large earthquake such as a San Andreas rupture are modulated by several factors including earthquake source magnitude and rupture length, path effects into the LA Basin, and local basin effects. In this study, we analyze the direct effect of shallow basin structures on ground motion intensity and duration at long period (up to 2 seconds) in the Los Angeles region through modeling local, small magnitude earthquakes and dense array analysis. Observations show that shallow events produce longer and stronger shaking compared to deeper events. 3D simulations using CVMS4.26 show good waveform fitting at 5 seconds and longer, but fail to predict the long significant shaking and late arrivals at shorter period. The implementation of higher Q in the simulations improves the waveform fitting but still does not fully reproduce the late arrivals. Beam-forming analysis using a dense array within the basin further reveals important factors that control ground motion at long period. The strongest shaking is generated along the great circle path, with increasing slowness, indicating the role of shallow, slow-velocity structures near the surface. Later arrivals are scattered from off-azimuth directions, with potential scatterers such as sharp boundaries offshore. Better imaging of these shallow heterogeneities and sharp boundaries will improve our overall capability in predicting ground motions in future earthquakes.}

A global data set was assembled from 360 earthquakes between 1994 and 2017. The empirical wavelet approach permits documentation of the degree of similarity of every observed wave with the empirical wavelet. We adapt the empirical wavelet to all pulse widths, thus identifying broadened (e.g., attenuated) pulses. Several measures of goodness of fit of the empirical wavelet to each record are documented, as well as signal-to-noise ratios, permitting users of the data set to employ flexible weighting schemes. We demonstrate the approach on transversely polarized SH waves and build a global travel time data set for the waves S, SS, SSS, Sdiff, ScS, and ScSScS. Onset arrival times of the waves were determined through a correlation scheme with best-fitting empirical wavelets. Over 250,000 travel times were picked, from over 1.4 million records, all of which were human-checked for accuracy via a Portable Document Format (PDF) catalog file making system. Many events were specifically selected to bolster southern hemisphere coverage. Coverage maps show that, while the northern hemisphere is more densely sampled, the southern hemisphere coverage is robust. The travel time data set, empirical wavelets, and all measurement metrics are publicly available and well suited for global tomography, as well as forward modeling experiments.},

Seismic ground motion-based observations promise to provide new, remote constraints on debris flow physics, but the lack of data and a theoretical basis for interpreting them hinders progress. Here we present a new mechanistic physical model for the seismic ground motion of debris flows and apply this to the devastating debris flows in Montecito, California on 9 January 2018. The amplitude and frequency characteristics of the seismic data can distinguish debris flows from other seismic sources and enable the estimation of debris-flow speed, width, boulder sizes, and location. Results suggest that present instrumentation could have provided 5 min of early warning over limited areas, whereas a seismic array designed for debris flows would have provided 10 min of warning for most of the city. Plain Language Summary Rainwater carries mud and rocks down hillsides, forming debris flows. Debris flows not only shape the landscape but also pose a major hazard to human life and infrastructure, as exemplified by what occurred in Montecito, California on 9 January 2018. An effective early warning system for debris flows would accurately determine the location and magnitude of debris flow events and could help save lives. Progress has been made in using seismic ground motions produced by debris flows for this purpose. However, the development of such early warning methods depends on effective collection of data as well as fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanics, both of which have been lacking. Here we discovered that the ground motion caused by debris flows is well recorded with current technologies and has unique characteristics that can be understood through a mechanistic model. These unique characteristics, together with the new mechanistic model, allow us to estimate key information about the debris flows, including the speed, width, rock sizes, and location. With present instrumentation, early warning could have provided 5 min of warning over limited areas. Implementation of a seismic array designed for debris flows would have provided 10 min of warning for most of the city.},

We analyzed the direct effect of shallow basin structures on shaking duration at a period of 2\textendash 10 s in the Los Angeles region through modeling small magnitude, shallow, and deep earthquake pairs. The source depth modulates the basin response, particularly the shaking duration, and these features are a function of path effect and not site condition. Three-dimensional simulations using the CVM-S4.26.M01 velocity model show good fitting to the initial portion of the waveforms at periods of 5 s and longer but fail to predict the long shaking duration during shallow events, especially at periods less than 5 s. Simulations using CVM-H do not match the timing of the initial arrivals as well as CVM-S4.26.M01, and the strong late arrivals in the CVM-H simulation travel with an apparent velocity slower than observed. A higher-quality factor than traditionally assumed may produce synthetics with longer durations but is unable to accurately match the amplitude and phase. Beamforming analysis using dense array data further reveals the long duration surface waves have the same back azimuth as the direct arrivals and are generated at the basin edges, while the later coda waves are scattered from off-azimuth directions, potentially due to strong, sharp boundaries offshore. Improving the description of these shallow basin structures and attenuation model will enhance our capability to predict long-period ground motions in basins.},

In general, the model for seismic-wave propagation is enough to be appropriate for body and surface waves propagating from nearby seismic sources but can be simplified into a plane-wave model. Although computation of the spatial gradient requires that array elements be closer than 10\% of the horizontal wavelength, seismic-array apertures, in the usual sense, may extend over many horizontal wavelengths and illuminate changes within the wave field. Array images of horizontal slowness and the relative geometrical-spreading changes of seismic waves are derived using filter theory and used to interpret observed array wave fields. Errors in computing finite-difference spatial gradients from array nodes are explicitly considered to avoid spatial aliasing in the estimates. I apply the method to interpret waves in strong ground motion and small-scale refraction data sets. Use of the wave spatial gradient accentuates spatial differences in the wave field that can be theoretically exploited in fine-scale tomographic studies of structure and is complementary to frequency/wavenumber or beam-forming array-processing techniques.},

One coefficient gives the relative change of wave geometrical spreading with distance and the other gives the horizontal slowness and its change with distance. The essential feature of spatial gradient analysis is a time-domain relation between three seismograms that yields information on the amplitude and phase behavior of a seismic wave. Filter theory is used to find these coefficients for data from 2D areal arrays of seismometers, termed gradiometers. A finite-difference star is used to compute the displacement gradient for irregularly shaped gradiometers, and a relation for the frequency-dependent error in the displacement gradient is obtained and applied to ensure accurate estimates. This kind of array analysis is useful for gradiometers at any distance from a source and yields a variety of time-domain and frequency-domain views of wave-amplitude changes and horizontal phase velocity estimates across the gradiometer. For example, time-dependent horizontal slowness and wave-azimuth plots are natural results of the analysis. These time-domain maps may be used in conjunction with time-distance and horizontal slowness-distance models to locate seismic sources or may be used directly to study earth structure. These methods are demonstrated by using data from a small-aperture (similar to 40 m) seismic gradiometer.},

  abstract = {Interferometric radar images collected by ERS-1, ERS-2 and RADARSAT-1 are used to observe the rupture tip of rifts that propagate along Hemmen Ice Rise on the Ronne Ice Shelf, Antarctica. Interferograms generated in 1992 and 1997 allow for the observation of ice deformation accumulated over 9 and 24 days respectively. These interferograms are combined, in order to separate the continuous process of creep deformation from the more cyclic motion caused by variations in ocean tide. An examination of local gradients in creep deformation reveals the pattern of ice deformation around and near the rupture tips and rifts with great precision (up to 10 cm a(-1)). We compare the observations with a deformation model for ice and obtain the following results: (1) The tidal oscillation of the Ronne Ice Shelf only yields small deformations along the rifts and near the rupture tips. (2) Along the ice front, the rifts and at the rupture tips, vertical bending is observed which is well explained by a model of viscous deformation of ice. Furthermore, the model indicates that the deformation pattern observed at the rupture tips is a sensitive indicator of the propagation state of the rifts (i.e. active vs inactive). (3) The viscous adjustment of ice is the dominant mode of deformation, masking the deformation pattern predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). (4) Yet, at a spatial scale equivalent to the length of a rift, the propagation rate is well predicted by LEFM.},

We explore numerical convection calculations for two proposed hypotheses for these anomalies, namely, thermal upwellings (e.g., plume clusters) and large intrinsically dense piles of mantle material (e.g., thermochemical piles), each of which uniquely affects the topography on Earth's core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB). The thermochemical pile models predict a relatively flat but elevated CMB beneath piles (presumed LLSVPs), with strong upwarping along LLSVP margins. The plume cluster models predict CMB upwarping beneath upwellings that are less geographically organized. Both models display CMB depressions beneath subduction related downwelling. While each of the two models produces a unique, characteristic style of CMB topography, we find that seismic models will require shorter length scales than are currently being employed in order to distinguish between the end-member dynamic models presented here.},

  abstract = {Numerous seismic studies reveal the presence of two large, low velocity anomalies beneath Africa and the central Pacific. Efforts to characterize these anomalies have yielded a variety of interpretations over the years, both isochemical and thermochemical. Previous interpretations have included large, isochemical superplumes, clusters of smaller thermal plumes, and doming thermochemical superplumes. A conceptual mantle model that is presently growing favor involves long-lived thermochemical piles. In anticipation that nutation studies will provide better topographic constraints on the core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB) in the future, we examine the effects of thermochemical piles at this boundary. In this study, we perform numerical modeling of thermochemical and isochemical convection as a function of convective vigor and temperature-dependent viscosity to predict the topography at Earth's CMB. Our results show that in isochemical convection, downwellings always lead to negative (depressed) CMB topography, while upwellings cause positive (elevated) topography, consistent with previous studies. However, in thermochemical convection, CMB topography and its relationship to downwellings and thermochemical piles are significantly affected by temperature-dependent viscosity. For isoviscous or weakly temperature-dependent viscosity, the piles cause negative CMB topography, while positive topography is often below cold downwellings. However, for realistic, more strongly temperaturedependent viscosity, the most negative CMB topography is below downwellings, while the topography below the piles is often slightly more positive and/or flat, similar to upwellings in isochemical models. We also show that although thermochemical piles are intrinsically more dense, the large thermal buoyancy associated with them leads to overall relative buoyancy that is on par with slabs. Consequently, thermochemical models lead to an overall reduction in magnitude of CMB topography with respect to isochemical models.},

However, NCF amplitudes are highly debated due to noise source intensity and distribution, seismic intrinsic attenuation, scattering, and elastic path effects such as focusing and defocusing. We prove with various numerical simulations that the NCFs calculated for a uniformly dispersive medium using the coherency method preserve accurate geometrical spreading and attenuation decay. We show that for a wide range of noise source distributions, the coherency of the noise correlation functions matches a Bessel function decaying exponentially with a specific attenuation coefficient. Conditions needed to obtain these results include averaging over long enough time intervals, a uniformly distributed seismic network, and a good distribution of far-field noise sources. We also show that the estimated attenuation coefficient corresponds to the interstation and not the noise-source-to-receiver structure.},

In F3DT, the sensitivity (Fr\'echet) kernels are computed using numerical solutions of the 3-D elastodynamic equation and the nonlinearity of the structural inversion problem is accounted for through an iterative tomographic navigation process. More than half-a-million misfit measurements made on about 38,000 earthquake seismograms and 12,000 ambient-noise correlagrams have been assimilated into our inversion. After 26 F3DT iterations, synthetic seismograms computed using our latest model, CVM-S4.26, show substantially better fit to observed seismograms at frequencies below 0.2 Hz than those computed using our 3-D starting model CVM-S4 and the other SCEC CVM, CVM-H11.9, which was improved through 16 iterations of AW-F3DT. CVM-S4.26 has revealed strong crustal heterogeneities throughout Southern California, some of which are completely missing in CVM-S4 and CVM-H11.9 but exist in models obtained from previous crustal-scale 2-D active-source refraction tomography models. At shallow depths, our model shows strong correlation with sedimentary basins and reveals velocity contrasts across major mapped strike-slip and dip-slip faults. At middle to lower crustal depths, structural features in our model may provide new insights into regional tectonics. When combined with physics-based seismic hazard analysis tools, we expect our model to provide more accurate estimates of seismic hazards in Southern California.},

This includes models for Europan ambient noise and conditions on signal-to-noise ratio necessary for the proposed technique to be feasible.

  abstract = {Earth's lower mantle is dominated by a pair of antipodal large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) that reach 4 1000 km up from the core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB). These are separated by a ring of faster-than-average velocities thought to be related to subduction of oceanic lithosphere. How robustly does global tomography constrain velocity structure in the lower mantle, and are there other robust large scale features that have not been identified? We use cluster analysis to identify structures and seismic characteristics common to a set of recent global tomographic models which have been derived using different data sets, parameterizations, and theory behind approximations used in inversion. We detect a pronounced asymmetry in the velocity gradient with depth between seismically fast and slow regions in the lowermost 500 km of the mantle, suggesting the presence of compositional heterogeneity. We find that, in all models, there is a clear separation of lower mantle structure into one fast and two slow regions, and that the boundary of the regions is remarkably similar across models even on length scales as small as o1000 km. This inter-model similarity indicates that long wavelength features are not a consequence of lack of fine-scale resolution, but that they truly dominate the structure in the lowermost mantle. There is a single exception to this separation: an isolated slow anomaly \$ 900 km across (at the CMB) and extending \$ 500 km upward from the core\textendash mantle boundary, which we call the ``Perm Anomaly''. Though it is far smaller than an LLSVP, waveform analysis confirms that this anomaly is robustly constrained and bounded by rapid lateral velocity gradients like those found around LLSVPs, suggesting that the nature and process of formation of both types of structures may be related.},

Recorded at permanent Global Seismic Network (GSN) and temporary SSCUA deployment broadband seismographic stations in Antarctica, the new data improve the previously poor and biased coverage that underlies the seismic constraints on recent models of inner core structure and anisotropy. On the one hand, new differential PKP traveltime measurements improve the sampling of predominantly the eastern inner core hemisphere. PKPab-df and PKPbc-df differential traveltime residuals, with respect to the spherically symmetric model ak135, are consistently smaller than two seconds along the north\textendash south paths sampled. Axially symmetric models of inner core seismic anisotropy with fast axis parallel to the Earth's rotation axis require a weak anisotropy of (0.7 {$\pm$} 0.1) per cent to be consistent with our PKPbc-df observations. PKPbc-df residuals from the quasi-eastern hemisphere indicate (0.4 {$\pm$} 0.1) per cent anisotropy. If only PKPbc-df observations from the top 200 km of this hemisphere are considered, this is reduced to (0.1 {$\pm$} 0.2) per cent, consistent with an isotropic layer. On the other hand, new absolute PKP traveltime measurements add to the sampling of both hemispheres of the inner core, but it is difficult to use them with more confidence to assess structure of the core since they are affected by crustal and mantle structure and source uncertainties. The newly collected data set also increases constraints on D" structure beneath the South Pole. In contrast to previous inferences based on data from northern stations, we find no evidence of a velocity heterogeneity in the outer core near the inner core boundary associated with the cylinder tangent to the inner core in the southern hemisphere.},

Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation (including the turbulent regime). Our Fourier neural operator shows state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural network methodologies and it is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.},

We address several issues involving 2-D FD methods in generating global synthetic seismograms. These include: (1) interfacing point source excitation for earthquakes with 2-D FD methods; (2) out-of-plane spreading corrections and (3) reducing the spherical Earth to the flattened models. The first issue is tackled using two methods, a `transparent source box' approach and a moment tensor excitation approach, where each has its own advantages. Moreover, our `source box' excitation does not have the late-time drift problem that occurred in previous studies. The out-of-plane geometric spreading correction is accounted for by estimating the ray parameter and applying a post-simulation filter to 2-D synthetics. Finally, parameters of the Earth-flattening transformation are discussed and validated. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by comparing our synthetics with frequency\textendash wavenumber summation, normal-mode and 3-D spectral-element synthetics.},

  abstract = {A two-and-half dimensional model-based inversion algorithm for the reconstruction of geometry and conductivity of unknown regions using marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data is presented. In the model-based inversion, the inversion domain is described by the so-called regional conductivity model and both geometry and material parameters associated with this model are reconstructed in the inversion process. This method has the advantage of using a priori information such as the background conductivity distribution, structural information extracted from seismic and/or gravity measurements, and/or inversion results a priori derived from a pixel-based inversion method. By incorporating this a priori information, the number of unknown parameters to be retrieved becomes significantly reduced. The inversion method is the regularized Gauss-Newton minimization scheme. The robustness of the inversion is enhanced by adopting nonlinear constraints and applying a quadratic line search algorithm to the optimization process. We also introduce the adjoint formulation to calculate the Jacobian matrix with respect to the geometrical parameters. The model-based inversion method is validated by using several numerical examples including the inversion of the Troll field data. These results show that the modelbased inversion method can quantitatively reconstruct the shapes and conductivities of reservoirs.},

Since our entire formulation is based on solving eikonal and advection equations on finite-difference meshes, our traveltime tomography strategy is carried out without computing rays explicitly. We incorporate reflection traveltime data into the formulation so that possible reflectors (slowness interfaces) in the targeted subsurface model can be recovered as well as the slowness distribution itself. Since a reflector may assume a variety of irregular geometries, we propose to use a level-set function to implicitly parametrize the shape of a reflector. Therefore, a mismatch functional is established to minimize the traveltime data misfit with respect to both the slowness distribution and the level-set function, and the minimization is achieved by using a gradient descent method with gradients computed by solving adjoint state equations. To assess uncertainty or reliability of reconstructed slowness models, we introduce a labelling function to characterize first-arrival ray coverage of the computational domain, and this labelling function satisfies an advection equation. We apply fast-sweeping type methods to solve eikonal, adjoint-state and advection equations arising in our formulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust to noise in the measurements, and can recover complicated structure even with little information on the reflector.},

The estimated Z/H ratios from earthquake and ambient noise data show good consistency within the overlapped periods. The observed Z/H ratio shows a good spatial correlation with surface geology and is systematically low within the basins. We jointly invert the measured Z/H ratio and phase velocity dispersion data to obtain a refined 3-D S wave velocity model beneath the NE China. At shallow depth, the 3-D model is featured by strong low-velocity anomalies that are spatially well correlated with the Songliao, Sanjiang, and Erlian basins. The low-velocity anomaly beneath the Songliao basin extends to 2\textendash 3 km deep in the south and 5\textendash 6 km in the north. At lower crustal depths, we find a significant low-velocity anomaly beneath the Great Xing'an range that extends to the upper mantle in the south. Overall, the deep structures of the 3-D model are consistent with previous models, but the shallow structures show a much better spatial correlation with tectonic terranes. The difference in sedimentary structure between the southern and northern Songliao basin is likely caused by a mantle upwelling associated with the Pacific subduction.},

The method is designed to deal with a specific class of 3D magnetic inverse problems in which the magnetic susceptibility is known and the objective of the inversion is to find the boundary or geometric shape of the causative bodies. We adopt the conceptual representation of the subsurface geologic structure by a set of magnetic bodies, each having a uniform magnetic susceptibility embedded in a nonmagnetic background. This representation enables us to reformulate the magnetic inverse problem into a domain inverse problem for those unknown domains defining the supports of the magnetic causative bodies. Because each body may take on a variety of shapes, and we may not know the number of bodies a priori either, we use multiple level-set functions to parameterize these domains so that the domain inverse problem can be further reduced to an optimization problem of multiple level-set functions. To efficiently compute gradients of the nonlinear functional arising from the multiple level-set formulation, we take advantage of the rapid decay of the magnetic kernels with distance to significantly speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in the minimization process. We apply the new method to the synthetic and field data sets and determine its effectiveness.},

Improved constraints on upper-crustal structure result from use of short-period Rayleigh-wave ellipticity, or Rayleigh-wave H/V (horizontal to vertical) amplitude ratios, measurements determined using multicomponent ambient noise cross-correlations. To retain the amplitude ratio information between vertical and horizontal components, for each station, we perform daily noise pre-processing (temporal normalization and spectrum whitening) simultaneously for all three components. For each station pair, amplitude measurements between cross-correlations of different components (radial-radial, radial-vertical, vertical-radial and vertical-vertical) are then used to determine the Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios at the two station locations. We use all EarthScope/USArray Tranportable Array data available between 2007 January and 2011 June to determine the Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios and their uncertainties at all station locations and construct new Rayleigh-wave H/V ratio maps in the western United States between periods of 8 and 24 s. Combined with previous longer period earthquake Rayleigh-wave H/V ratio measurements and Rayleigh-wave phase velocity measurements from both ambient noise and earthquakes, we invert for a new 3-D crustal and upper-mantle model in the western United States. Correlation between the inverted model and known geological features at all depths suggests good resolution in five crustal layers. Use of short-period Rayleigh-wave H/V ratio measurements based on noise cross-correlation enables resolution of distinct near surface features such as the Columbia River Basalt flows, which overlie a thick sedimentary basin.},

  abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in R2 only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat\'ern class, provide an explicit link , for any triangulation of Rd , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

  abstract = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a novel tool in array seismology that measures the phase of backscattered laser pulses traveling in a fiber-optic cable, and relates this measurement to the axial strain induced on the cable by a propagating seismic wavefield. Combining DAS with telecommunications optical fiber networks has begun to address a range of earth science questions where cost and field logistics have historically hindered observations. Unlike classic inertial seismometers, DAS instrument response is presently unquantified. This topic includes a variable sensing element\textemdash the fiber, including packaging and installation\textemdash which changes between experiments. Ignoring this element, one DAS record should approximate a fixed-length strain gauge, which exactly measures Earth's motion down to quasi-static frequencies relevant to geodesy. In this paper, we test this hypothesis using seismological observations of teleseismic earthquakes and microseism noise spanning the 1 to 120 s period range. We use a commercial DAS interrogator unit connected to an optical fiber previously used for telecommunication and a colocated broadband seismometer to estimate the DAS transfer function. We find a 1:1 correspondence with actual ground motion from 10\textendash 120 s. At shorter periods (1\textendash 10 s), DAS amplitude response is enhanced by 3\textendash 11 dB. Phase response is flat over this range of periods. We interpret the recovered DAS response function in terms of hypothesized fiber coupling and photonic effects. We propose this calibration methodology for future DAS experiments where seismic amplitude information is desired.},

We analyze cataloged earthquake observations from three DAS arrays with different horizontal geometries to demonstrate some possibilities using this technology.

Using an L-shaped DAS array in Northern California, we record the nearly vertically incident arrival of an earthquake from The Geysers Geothermal Field and estimate its backazimuth and slowness via beamforming for different phases of the seismic wavefield.

The source\textendash receiver reciprocity in the ambient noise method implies that each station can be considered to be an effective source and the phase traveltime between that source and all other stations is used to track the phase front and construct the phase traveltime surface. Assuming that the amplitude of the waveform varies smoothly, the eikonal equation states that the gradient of the phase traveltime surface can be used to estimate both the local phase speed and the direction of wave propagation. For each location, we statistically summarize the distribution of azimuthally dependent phase speed measurements based on the phase traveltime surfaces centred on different effective source locations to estimate both the isotropic and azimuthally anisotropic phase speeds and their uncertainties. Examples are presented for the 12 and 24 s Rayleigh waves for the EarthScope/USArray Transportable Array stations in the western USA. We show that (1) the major resulting tomographic features are consistent with traditional inversion methods, (2) reliable uncertainties can be estimated for both the isotropic and anisotropic phase speeds, (3) `resolution' can be approximated by the coherence length of the phase speed measurements and is about equal to the station spacing, (4) no explicit regularization is required in the inversion process and (5) azimuthally dependent phase speed anisotropy can be observed directly without assuming its functional form.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a method for the empirical construction of 2-D surface wave phase traveltime finite frequency sensitivity kernels by using phase traveltime measurements obtained across a large dense seismic array. The method exploits the virtual source and reciprocity properties of the ambient noise cross-correlation method. The adjoint method is used to construct the sensitivity kernels, where phase traveltime measurements for an event (an earthquake or a virtual ambient noise source at one receiver) determine the forward wave propagation and a virtual ambient noise source at a second receiver gives the adjoint wave propagation. The interference of the forward and adjoint waves is then used to derive the empirical kernel. Examples of station station and earthquake station empirical finite frequency kernels within the western United States based on ambient noise and earthquake phase traveltime measurements across USArray stations are shown to illustrate the structural effects on the observed empirical sensitivity kernels. We show that a hybrid kernel constructed from the empirical kernel and the kernel for a reference model can be used to compute traveltimes accurate to second order in model perturbations for an earth-like model. A synthetic test demonstrates the application of such hybrid kernels to predict surface wave phase traveltimes.},

  abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has been primarily for mappings between a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and a set of classes, or between two finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The purpose of this work is to generalize neural networks so that they can learn mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces (operators). The key innovation in our work is that a single set of network parameters, within a carefully designed network architecture, may be used to describe mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces and between different finitedimensional approximations of those spaces. We formulate approximation of the infinite-dimensional mapping by composing nonlinear activation functions and a class of integral operators. The kernel integration is computed by message passing on graph networks. This approach has substantial practical consequences which we will illustrate in the context of mappings between input data to partial differential equations (PDEs) and their solutions. In this context, such learned networks can generalize among different approximation methods for the PDE (such as finite difference or finite element methods) and among approximations corresponding to different underlying levels of resolution and discretization. Experiments confirm that the proposed graph kernel network does have the desired properties and show competitive performance compared to the state of the art solvers.},

  abstract = {The growth of the Earthscope/USArray Transportable Array (TA) has prompted the development of new methods in surface wave tomography that track phase fronts across the array and map the traveltime field for each earthquake or for each station from ambient noise. Directionally dependent phase velocities are determined locally by measuring the gradient of the observed traveltime field without the performance of a formal inversion. This method is based on the eikonal equation and is, therefore, referred to as `eikonal tomography'. Eikonal tomography is a bent-ray theoretic method, but does not account for finite frequency effects such as wave interference, wave front healing, or backward scattering. This shortcoming potentially may lead to both systematic bias and random error in the phase velocity measurements, which would be particularly important at the longer periods studied with earthquakes. It is shown here that eikonal tomography can be improved by using amplitude measurements to construct a geographically localized correction via the Helmholtz equation. This procedure should be thought of as a finite-frequency correction that does not require the construction of finite-frequency kernels and is referred to as `Helmholtz tomography'. We demonstrate the method with Rayleigh wave measurements following earthquakes between periods of 30 and 100 s in the western US using data from the TA. With Helmholtz tomography at long periods ({$>$}50 s): (1) resolution of small-scale isotropic structures, which correspond to known geological features, is improved, (2) uncertainties in the isotropic phase velocity maps are reduced, (3) the directionally dependent phase velocity measurements are less scattered, (4) spurious 1-psi azimuthal anisotropy near significant isotropic structural contrasts is reduced, and (5) estimates of 2-psi anisotropy are better correlated across periods.},

The array was composed of more than 5200 stations with an average spacing close to 100 m. Three weeks of passive ambient noise were crosscorrelated between each station pair, which resulted in more than 13.5 million crosscorrelations within the area. Clear fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves were observed between 0.5 and 4 Hz, which were most sensitive to structure above 1-km depth. For each station pair, we applied frequency-time analysis to determine the phase traveltime dispersion, and, for each frequency, we applied eikonal tomography to determine the Rayleigh wave phase velocity map. The eikonal tomography accounted for ray bending by tracking the wavefront and allowed uncertainties to be estimated through statistical analysis. The compilation of phase velocity maps was then used to invert for 3D shear velocity structure. The inverted model showed clear correlation with the known geologic features such as the shallow south\textendash north velocity dichotomy and a deeper fast anomaly associated with the NewportInglewood fault zone. Our results can potentially be used to complement traditional active source studies.},

In this study, we jointly invert measurements of Rayleigh wave H/V ratio and phase velocity between 24-100 and 8-100 sec period, respectively, for crust and upper mantle structure beneath more than 1000 USArray stations covering the western United States. Upper crustal structure, in particular, is better constrained by the joint inversion compared to inversions based on phase velocities alone. In addition to imaging Vs structure, we show that the joint inversion can be used to constrain Vp/Vs and density in the upper crust. New images of uppermost crustal structure ({$<$}3 km depth) are in excellent agreement with known surface features, with pronounced low Vs, low density, and high Vp/Vs anomalies imaged in the locations of several major sedimentary basins including the Williston, Powder River, Green River, Denver, and San Juan basins. These results demonstrate not only the consistency of broadband H/V ratios and phase velocity measurements, but also that their complementary sensitivities have the potential to resolve density and Vp/Vs variations.

All available three-component time-series for the 12-month span between 2005 November 1 and 2006 October 31 have been cross-correlated to yield estimated empirical Rayleigh and Love wave Green's functions. The Love wave signals were observed with higher average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than Rayleigh wave signals and hence cannot be fully explained by the scattering of Rayleigh waves. Phase velocity dispersion curves for both Rayleigh and Love waves between 5 and 40 speriod were measured for each interstation path by applying frequency-time analysis. The average uncertainty and systematic bias of the measurements are estimated using a method based on analysing thousands of nearly linearly aligned station-triplets. We find that empirical Green's functions can be estimated accurately from the negative time derivative of the symmetric component ambient noise cross-correlation without explicit knowledge of the source distribution. The average traveltime uncertainty is less than 1 s at periods shorter than 24 s. We present Rayleigh and Love wave phase speed maps at periods of 8, 12, 16,and 20 s.

  abstract = {Deep body waves have been reconstructed from seismic noise correlations in recent studies. The authors note their great potential for deep-Earth imaging. In addition to the expected physical seismic phases, some spurious arrivals having no correspondence in earthquake seismograms are observed from the noise correlations. The origins of the noise-derived body waves have not been well understood. Traditionally, the reconstruction of seismic phases from inter-receiver noise correlations is attributed to the interference between waves from noise sources in the stationary-phase regions. The interfering waves emanating from a stationary-phase location have a common ray path from the source to the first receiver. The correlation operator cancels the common path and extracts a signal corresponding to the inter-receiver ray path. In this study, with seismic noise records from two networks at teleseismic distance, we show that noise-derived spurious seismic signals without correspondence in real seismograms can arise from the interference between waves without a common ray path or common slowness. These noise-derived signals cannot be explained by traditional stationary-phase arguments. Numerical experiments reproduce the observed spurious signals. These signals still emerge for uniformly distributed noise sources, and thus are not caused by localized sources. We interpret the presence of the spurious signals with a less restrictive condition of quasi-stationary phase: providing the time delays between interfering waves from spatially distributed noise sources are close enough, the stack of correlation functions over the distributed sources can still be constructive as an effect of finite frequencies, and thereby noise-derived signals emerge from the source averaging.},

This decomposition is intrinsically nonlinear and calls for a nonconvex least-squares optimization formulation, along the lines of full-waveform inversion. To overcome the lack of convexity, we have developed an iterative refinement-expansion scheme to initialize and track the phase and amplitude for each atomic event. For short, we called the method phase tracking. The initialization is carried out by applying multiple signal classification to a few seed traces in which events can be separated and identified by their arrival times and amplitudes. We then construct the initial solution at the seed traces using linear phase functions from the arrival times and constant amplitude functions, assuming the medium is mostly dispersion free. We refine this initial solution to account for dispersion and imperfect knowledge of the wavelet at the seed traces by fitting the observed data using a gradient descent method. The resulting phase and amplitude functions are then carefully expanded across the traces in an adequately smooth way to match the whole data record. We have evaluated the proposed method on two synthetic records and a field record. Because the parametrization of the seismic events is physically meaningful, it also enables a simple form of bandwidth extension of the observed shot record to unobserved low and high frequencies. We tested this procedure on the same shot records. Bandwidth extension is in principle helpful to initialize full-waveform inversion with frequency sweeps and enhanced its resolution.},

Recent studies using synthetics have shown that application of template matching to large-N arrays can potentially detect earthquakes substantially below the noise level. Here we apply template matching to the distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data recorded in the Brady Hot Springs geothermal field, Nevada. Using 5 catalogued events, we detect 116 events and find 68 of them well below the noise level. We confirm 112 events are true earthquakes by examining the patterns of their sensor-tosensor cross-correlation sections. This demonstrates that the combination of DAS and template matching has capability to detect microseismicity below the noise level, which is unusual for conventional seismic arrays and methods. With the updated catalogue, we observe a surge of earthquakes during the shutdown of a geothermal power plant nearby. In addition, the rapid increases in the downhole pressure record coincide with intense swarms of earthquakes. These observations show a strong correlation between the seismicity frequencies and the downhole pressure changes. Finally, we investigate several factors that may affect the detection performance and compare different strategies for spatial down-sampling, in order to provide helpful insights for future large-N design and data processing.},

  abstract = {Seismic signals can be extracted from ambient noise wavefields by the correlation technique. Recently, a prominent P-type phase was observed from teleseismic noise correlations in the secondary microseism period band. The phase is named Pdmc in this paper, corresponding to its origin from the interference between the direct P waves transmitting through the deep mantle and the core (P and PKPab waves). We extract the phase by correlating noise records from two seismic networks in the Northern Hemisphere and locate the microseism sources that are efficient for the Pdmc construction in the South Pacific. We investigate the spatiotemporal links of the Pdmc signal with global oceanic waves and microseism sources. Interestingly, the correlation with wave height is higher in several regions surrounding the effective source region, rather than in the effective source region. The Pdmc amplitude is highly correlated with the power of the effective microseism sources. Also, it is apparently correlated with ineffective sources in the Southern Hemisphere and anticorrelated with sources in the Northern Hemisphere. We ascribe the correlation with the ineffective southern sources to the spatiotemporal interconnections of the southern sources. The anticorrelation with northern sources can be explained by the reverse seasonal patterns between the southern and northern sources and by that the northern sources impede the signal construction. The signal construction from noise correlations relies on the competition between the effective and ineffective sources, not just on the power of the effective sources. This principle should be valid in a general sense for noise-derived signals. Plain Language Summary Earth is experiencing tiny but incessant movement induced by natural forces, particularly, storm-driven ocean waves. While this ambient seismic noise (microseism) was deemed a nuisance in the past, it can be turned into signals via the seismic correlation technique. Recently, a new P-type phase was derived from the noise correlations between two regional seismic networks. The noise-derived phase originates from the correlation between P waves that propagate through the deep mantle and outer core of the Earth. The temporal amplitude variations of the noise-derived signals are compared with the variations of microseism sources in the oceans. We show that the signal emergence depends on the competition between the sources in a specific region that contribute to the signals and sources in other regions. The conclusion can be generalized to other noise-derived seismic phases. We also analyze the links of the noise-derived signals to ocean waves. In our case, the ocean waves in the contributing source region are dominated by wind seas forced by local winds, whereas the excitation of microseisms is primarily owing to the freely traveling swells generated by oceanic storms in surrounding regions.},

The faulting geometry and kinematic coseismic slip distribution of both events are determined by jointly inverting seismological and geodetic observations guided by aftershock and surface rupture locations. The foreshock ruptured two orthogonal faults with a prominent L-shaped geometry with maximum slip of 1.1 m on the NE-SW segment. The mainshock faulting extended NW-SE along several primary fault segments that straddle the foreshock slip. The surface rupture and slip model indicate mostly near-horizontal strike-slip motion with maximum slip of 3.7 m, but there is a localized vertical dip-slip motion. Both the foreshock and mainshock ruptures terminate in regions of complex surface offsets. High aftershock productivity and low rupture velocity may be the result of rupture of a relatively immature fault system.},

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckleyand LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence On uniformly convex problems.},

Such effects should be taken into account, otherwise the S-velocity model inverted from the Rayleigh or Love dispersion curves will contain significant inaccuracies. Here, we show that the recently developed wave-equation dispersion inversion (WD) method naturally takes into account the effects of topography to give accurate S-velocity tomograms. Application of topographic WD (TWD) to synthetic data demonstrates that TWD can accurately invert for the S-velocity model from dispersion curves computed from data recorded over variable topography. This method is applied to ambient noise seismic field data recorded along the Clark strand of the San Jacinto fault zone (SJFZ) in Southern California. The resulting TWD S-velocity tomogram appears to be more consistent with the geology than the standard WD tomogram.},

  abstract = {Subducting slabs create strong short wavelength seismic anomalies in the upper mantle where much of Earth's seismicity is located. As such, they have the potential to bias longer-wavelength seismic tomography models. To evaluate the effect of subducting slabs in global tomography, we performed a series of inversions using a global synthetic shear wave traveltime data set for a theoretical slab model based on predicted thermal anomalies within slabs. The spectral element method was applied to predict the traveltime anomalies produced by the 3-D slab model for paths corresponding to our current data used in actual tomography models. Inversion tests have been conducted first using the raw traveltime anomalies to check how well the slabs can be imaged in global tomography without the effect of earthquake mislocation. Our results indicate that most of the slabs can be identified in the inversion result but with smoothed and reduced amplitude. The recovery of the total mass anomaly in slab regions is about 88 per cent. We then performed another inversion test to investigate the effect of mislocation caused by subducting slabs. We found that source mislocation largely removes slab signal and significantly degrades the imaging of subducting slabs-potentially reducing the recovery of mass anomalies in slab regions to only 41 per cent. We tested two source relocation procedures-an iterative relocation inversion and joint relocation inversion. Both methods partially recover the true source locations and improve the inversion results, but the joint inversion method worked significantly better than the iterative method. In all of our inversion tests, the amplitudes of artefact structures in the lower mantle caused by the incorrect imaging of slabs (up to similar to 0.5 per cent S velocity anomalies) are comparable to some large-scale lower-mantle heterogeneities seen in global tomography studies. Based on our inversion tests, we suggest including a-priori subducting slabs in the starting models in global tomography studies and use joint relocation in the inversion.},

  abstract = {AKI (1969) first modeled coda waves of a local earthquake as a superposition of scattered surface waves. This paper attempts to clarify the constituents of surface-wave coda at long periods at very long lapse times. For a large earthquake of magnitude 7 or larger, vertical component oscillation in periods from 90 to 180 s persists for more than 20 hours from the earthquake origin time. Although the early portion of the coda envelope is successfully modeled by assuming incoherent scattered Rayleigh waves by heterogeneities distributed all over the Earth, the later potion of the observed coda envelope (roughly later than 35,000 s) has systematically larger amplitude than theoretical prediction. To clarify the cause of this discrepancy, we studied the constituents of vertical-component seismograms of three large earthquakes recorded by the F-net in Japan using the f-k power spectral analysis. We found that the direct and scattered fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves of velocity about 3.7 km/s are dominant in the earlier part of each envelope. It justifies the use of a scattering model of the fundamental Rayleigh waves for synthesizing the envelope. At lapse times later than 20,000 s\textendash 35,000 s, higher modes with phase velocities around 20 km/s become dominant. The transition time to the dominance of higher modes is found to become earlier for a deeper focus earthquake. The small coda attenuation factor from (1.90{$\pm$}0.23) {$\cdot$} 10)3 to (2.38{$\pm$}0.32) {$\cdot$} 10)3 estimated from later coda envelopes recorded at IRIS stations distributed worldwide also agrees with the attenuation factor of spheroidal modes according to PREM. We may interpret that higher mode waves are uniformly distributed at large lapse time due to large velocity dispersion and/or scattering and they dominate over the fundamental mode waves because of smaller attenuation in the lower mantle. The coda attenuation measurement proposed by Aki is found to be useful even for long periods and at very large lapse times.},

Outside of the basins, the model crust is based on regional tomographic results. The model Moho is represented by a surface with the depths determined by the receiver function technique. Shallow basin sediment velocities are constrained by geotechnical data. The model is implemented in a computer code that generates any specified 3D mesh of seismic velocity and density values. This parameterization is convenient to store, transfer, and update as new information and verification results become available.},

The basement depth controls the cut-off period of the first higher mode, which coincides with a rapid increase (over period) in the particle-motion ellipticity or H/V ratio of the fundamental mode. The strong higher mode we observed is not only due to the low-velocity sedimentary layer but also due to the noise sources with significant radial component such as the basin edge scattering.

We reproduce the data using a simple forward model of gravity perturbations from normal modes. To do this, we stack data from multiple flybys to improve sensitivity. We find a partially degenerate set of normal-mode energy spectra that successfully reproduce the unknown gravity signal from Cassini's flybys. Although there is no unique solution, we find that the models most likely to fit the data are dominated by gravitational contributions from p-modes between 500 and 700 {$\mu$}Hz. Because f-modes at lower frequencies have stronger gravity signals for a given amplitude, this result would suggest strong frequency dependence in normalmode excitation on Saturn. We predict peak amplitudes for p-modes on the order of several kilometers, at least an order of magnitude larger than the peak amplitudes inferred by Earth-based observations of Jupiter. The large p-mode amplitudes we predict on Saturn, if they are indeed present and steady state, would imply weak damping with a lower bound of Q{$>$}107 for these modes, consistent with theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of earthquake occurrences is controlled both by fault interaction processes and by long-term, tectonic loading of the faults. In addition, transient loading can be caused by aseismic deformation episodes, for example during crustal fluid migration or slow slip events. These forcing transients are best revealed by geodetic measurements. However, this type of instrumentation is not always available, or is not always sensitive enough to detect significant anomalies. In such cases, one is better off exploiting the seismicity signature of these transients in order to characterize them. We here explore different ways to do so. Interearthquake time statistics are found to be prone to damping out fluctuations in forcing rate. A more accurate method is developed by comparing the data with a triggering model that accounts for earthquake interactions. The changes in fault loading rates are then well recovered, both in duration and in intensity.},

We present compressional and shear wave mantle velocity models below south central Alaska that leverage a new seismometer deployment to produce the most complete image of the subducting Pacific-Yakutat plate to date. We image a steeply dipping slab extending below central Alaska to {$>$}400 km depth, which abruptly terminates east of \textasciitilde 145\textdegree W. There is no significant slab anomaly beneath the nearby Wrangell volcanoes. A paucity of volcanism is observed above the subducting Yakutat terrane, but the slab structure below 150 km depth and Wadati-Benioff zone here are similar to those along the Aleutian-Alaska arc. Features of the mantle wedge or overlying lithosphere are thus responsible for the volcanic gap.},

We show this through theoretical analysis of planar Rayleigh, Love, P- and S-waves over both infinitesimally small and realistic gauge lengths. We extend the analysis of individual sensor detection of surface plane waves waves to inter-receiver cross-correlations of these detections. Finally we simulate random sources distributed around particle velocity and axial strain sensors in several configurations. The extraction of Rayleigh wave signals from ambient noise interferometry is more straightforward than Love wave signals, but with some receiver geometries and source distributions both Rayleigh and Love wave arrival times may be extracted.},

  abstract = {Horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratios of microtremors (HVRM) have been traditionally interpreted as representing either the S-wave amplification directly or the Rayleigh-wave ellipticity for a horizontally layered structure. However, based on the diffuse field theory, we have derived an alternative theoretical basis that HVRM corresponds to the square root of the ratio between the imaginary part of the horizontal Green's function and that of the vertical one. Under that condition, the 1D horizontal layering assumption is not needed to interpret HVRM. As observational evidence of such non-1D HVRM, we discovered significant directional dependency at a site on the Uji campus, Kyoto University, Japan. The observed microtremor north-south/vertical spectral ratios are quite stable and have only one peak around 0.5 Hz. On the other hand, the east-west/vertical spectral ratios are smaller in amplitude and have higher peak frequencies and sometimes two separated peaks. The directional dependency of observed HVRM is aligned to the axis of the 2D basin structure. We performed numerical analyses by spectral element method using a unit load on the surface to examine the effect of the 2D basin structure on the imaginary parts of the Green's functions. We found that the 2D basin structure clearly changes the characteristics of the H/V spectral ratios in both perpendicular and parallel directions relative to the basin axis. Thus, we succeeded in theoretically simulating the qualitative difference between the H/V spectral ratios for two orthogonal horizontal components of the HVRM observed on the Uji campus.},

These regions have been named the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), and they have spatial scales on the order of 1000s and 100s of kilometers in width and height, respectively. Discovering their cause remains an important challenge in the deep Earth community because recognizing what they are has important, first-order implications toward understanding the nature of global mantle convection and therefore, heat and chemical transport and evolution through time. At about an order-of-magnitude smaller scale are Ultra Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs) that reside on the core-mantle boundary. ULVZs are typically up to 100s of kilometers laterally and only 10s of kilometers vertically. We don't know what LLSVPs and ULVZs are, and the primary question is whether they are thermal or compositional features, and/or both. In any case, there is every reason to suppose that they are linked by a dynamical relationship, and by better understanding one, we can discover more about the other. Here, we review the observations associated with LLSVPs and the various conceptual mantle models that the community is debating regarding their cause. ULVZs, as they may relate to the larger LLSVPs, are also reviewed, and dynamical linkages between the two are discussed. Better understanding both LLSVPs and ULVZs promises to provide critical insight into global scale mantle convection and therefore provide a foundation for understanding numerous other processes in the Earth's interior.},

Our goal is to constrain the spherical harmonics power spectrum over the largest possible range of scales to get an estimate of the strength and statistical distribution of both long and small-scale structure. We use a spherical multitaper method to obtain high quality power spectral estimates from the regional models. After deconvolution of the employed taper functions, we combine global and regional spectral estimates from scales of 20 000 to around 200 km (degree 100). In contrast to previous studies that focus on linear power spectral densities, we interpret the logarithmic power per harmonic degree l as heterogeneity strength at a particular depth and horizontal scale. Throughout the mantle, we observe in recent global models, that their low degree spectrum is anisotropic with respect to Earth's rotation axis. We then constrain the uppermost mantle spectrum from global and regional models. Their power spectra transfer smoothly into each other in overlapping spectral bands, and model correlation is in general best in the uppermost 250 km (i.e. the `heterosphere'). In Europe, we see good correlation from the largest scales down to features of about 500 km. Detailed analysis and interpretation of spectral shape in this depth range shows that the heterosphere has several characteristic length scales and varying spectral decay rates. We interpret these as expressions of different physical processes. At larger depths, the correlation between different models drops, and the power spectrum exhibits strong small scale structure whose location and strength is not as well resolved at present. The spectrum also has bands with elevated power that likely correspond to length scales that are enhanced due to the inversion process.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport distance is an appealing tool to measure the discrepancy between datasets in the frame of inverse problems, for its ability to perform global comparisons and its convexity with respect to shifted patterns in the compared quantities. However, solving inverse problems might require to compare signed quantities, while the optimal transport theory has been developed for the comparison of probability measures. In this study we propose to circumvent this difficulty by applying optimal transport to the comparison of the graph of the data rather than the data itself. We investigate this approach in the frame of seismic imaging, where each channel of the oscillatory data is interpreted as a discrete point cloud. We demonstrate that the corresponding misfit function can be computed through the solution of series of linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), while, based on the adjoint state technique, its gradient can be computed from the assignment solution of these LSAP. We illustrate how this approach yields a convex misfit function in the frame of seismic imaging using the full waveform. We show how an efficient strategy, based on a specific LSAP solver, the auction algorithm, can be designed. We illustrate the interest of the approach on a realistic 2D visco-acoustic seismic imaging problem. The proposed strategy relaxes the constraint on the accuracy of the initial model, outperforming the conventional least-squares approach and a previously proposed optimal transport based approach. The computational time increases by only a few percents compared with the least-squares approach, opening the way to applications to 3D field data in the near future.},

Because in most seismograms, different types of waves with different frequencies may appear simultaneously, separation of waves is more effectively achieved when a time\textendash frequency analysis is performed. In this work, we propose a new time\textendash frequency analysis procedure to identify and extract Rayleigh and Love waves from three-component seismograms. Exploiting the advantage of the absolute phase preservation by the Stockwell transform, we construct time\textendash frequency filters to extract waves based on the normalized inner product (NIP). Because the NIP is the time\textendash frequency counterpart of the correlation, Rayleigh and Love waves can be identified depending on the NIP between the Stockwell transforms of the horizontal and vertical displacement components. The novelty and advantage of the proposed procedure is that it does not require specifying a priori the direction of propagation of the surface waves, but instead such direction is determined. Furthermore, it is shown that the NIP is a more stable parameter in the time\textendash frequency domain when compared to the instantaneous reciprocal ellipticity, and thus it avoids smoothing (and with it, altering) the data. The procedure has been successfully tested with real signals, specifically to extract Rayleigh and Love waves from seismograms of one aftershock of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. With the proposed procedure, we found different directions of propagation for retrograde and prograde Rayleigh waves, which might suggest that they are generated by different mechanisms.},

It also remains unknown why aftershock rates decay as \textasciitilde 1/time. Here, I show that these two are linked, with a dearth of aftershocks reflecting the absence of high-pressure fluid sources at depth, while rich and long-lasting aftershock sequences reflect tapping high-pressure fluid reservoirs that drive aftershock sequences. Using a physical model that captures the dominant aspects of permeability dynamics in the crust, I show that the model generates superior fits to observations than widely used empirical fits such as the Omori-Utsu Law, and find a functional relationship between aftershock decay rates and the tectonic ability to heal the co- and post-seismically generated fracture networks. These results have far-reaching implications, and can help interpret other observations such as seismic velocity recovery, attenuation, and migration.},

  abstract = {The estimation of finite fault earthquake source models is an inherently underdetermined problem: there is no unique solution to the inverse problem of determining the rupture history at depth as a function of time and space when our data are limited to observations at the Earth's surface. Bayesian methods allow us to determine the set of all plausible source model parameters that are consistent with the observations, our a priori assumptions about the physics of the earthquake source and wave propagation, and models for the observation errors and the errors due to the limitations in our forward model. Because our inversion approach does not require inverting any matrices other than covariance matrices, we can restrict our ensemble of solutions to only those models that are physically defensible while avoiding the need to restrict our class of models based on considerations of numerical invertibility. We only use prior information that is consistent with the physics of the problem rather than some artefice (such as smoothing) needed to produce a unique optimal model estimate. Bayesian inference can also be used to estimate model-dependent and internally consistent effective errors due to shortcomings in the forward model or data interpretation, such as poor Green's functions or extraneous signals recorded by our instruments. Until recently, Bayesian techniques have been of limited utility for earthquake source inversions because they are computationally intractable for problems with as many free parameters as typically used in kinematic finite fault models. Our algorithm, called cascading adaptive transitional metropolis in parallel (CATMIP), allows sampling of high-dimensional problems in a parallel computing framework. CATMIP combines the Metropolis algorithm with elements of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to dynamically optimize the algorithm's efficiency as it runs. The algorithm is a generic Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler; it works independently of the model design, a priori constraints and data under consideration, and so can be used for a wide variety of scientific problems. We compare CATMIP's efficiency relative to several existing sampling algorithms and then present synthetic performance tests of finite fault earthquake rupture models computed using CATMIP.},

Some earlier efforts to calculate the isotropic component of these sources are flawed due to an error in the method of Jost \& Herrmann. We corrected the method after Herrmann \& Hutchensen and found great improvement in the recovery of non-double-couple moment tensors that include an isotropic component. Tests with synthetic data demonstrate the stability of the corrected linear inversion method, and we recalculate the moment tensor solutions reported in Dreger et al. for Long Valley caldera events and Dreger \& Woods for Nevada Test Site nuclear explosions. We confirm the findings of Dreger et al. that the Long Valley volcanic sources contain large statistically significant isotropic components. The nuclear explosions have strikingly anomalous source mechanisms, which contain very large isotropic components, making it evident that these events are not tectonic in origin. This indicates that moment tensor inversions could be an important tool for nuclear monitoring.},

While traditional inference methods provide only point estimates of the model parameters, we aim at a full Bayesian treatment of model inference, allowing naturally to incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty quantification of the resulting estimates. Therefore, we introduce a highly flexible, non-parametric representation for the spatially varying ETAS background intensity through a Gaussian process (GP) prior. Combined with classical triggering functions this results in a new model formulation, namely the GP-ETAS model. We enable tractable and efficient Gibbs sampling by deriving an augmented form of the GP-ETAS inference problem. This novel sampling approach allows us to assess the posterior model variables conditioned on observed earthquake catalogues, i.e., the spatial background intensity and the parameters of the triggering function. Empirical results on two synthetic data sets indicate that GP-ETAS outperforms standard models and thus demonstrate the predictive power for observed earthquake catalogues including uncertainty quantification for the estimated parameters. Finally, a case study for the l'Aquila region, Italy, with the devastating event on 6 April 2009, is presented.},

  abstract = {A set of seismic observations which all sample the same structure in the same way should have zero variance. This is naturally the case if all sources are in the same place, and the data are recorded by the same station. If sources and/or receivers are not in the same place, but close to one another, variance will generally be nonzero, but small. Variance might become large if the sampled region of the Earth contains heterogeneities whose spatial wavelength is comparable to the distances between sources and between receivers (and thus between the corresponding ray paths). The travel-time variance of a ``bundle'' of seismic rays thus reflects the degree of complexity of the sampled region of the medium. We apply this simple principle to real seismic databases, attempting to constrain the spherical harmonic spectrum of Earth's structure without having to derive a tomographic model. This results in a reduction of the dimensionality of the solution space, and hence of computational costs. This approach allows to constrain the statistical properties, rather than exact geographic locations of structural features; knowing the statistics of Earth's structure is most valuable for many fundamental geodynamic questions. We follow an earlier study by Gudmundsson et al. [1990] to find an approximate analytical relationship between averaged variance and harmonic spectrum; this allows us to determine the latter from a measurement of the former via a linear least squares inversion. Our analysis shows that the variance of ray bundles associated with large geographic extent of source/receiver bins is sensitive to low-degree spectral power, and vice-versa for small bins/high harmonic degrees. The method is accordingly ineffective at very low harmonic degrees, associated with an inherently limited number of source-receiver bins. We conduct a suite of inversions of both real and synthetic seismic data sets to evaluate the resolving power of our algorithm, and attempt to identify a range of harmonic degrees where the method is robust. Our results indicate that the resolution of the Earth's spectrum afforded by the method presented here is inferior to that of classical tomography.},

The combination of data from these methods produces exceptionally broadband dispersion information from 6 to 100 s period, which constrains shear wave velocity structures in the crust and uppermost mantle to a depth of more than 100 km. The high lateral resolution produced by the TA network and the broadbandedness of the dispersion information motivate the question of the appropriate parameterization for a 3-D model, particularly for the crustal part of the model. We show that a relatively simple model in which V-S increases monotonically with depth in the crust can fit the data well across more than 90\% of the study region, except in eight discrete areas where greater crustal complexity apparently exists. The regions of greater crustal complexity are the Olympic Peninsula, the MendocinoTriple Junction, the Yakima Fold Belt, the southern Cascadia back arc, the Great Central Valley of California, the Salton Trough, the Snake River Plain, and the Wasatch Mountains. We also show that a strong Rayleigh-Love discrepancy exists across much of the western United States, which can be resolved by introducing radial anisotropy in both the mantle and notably the crust. We focus our analysis on demonstrating the existence of crustal radial anisotropy and primarily discuss the crustal part of the isotropic model that results from the radially anisotropic model by Voigt averaging. Model uncertainties from the Monte Carlo inversion are used to identify robust isotropic features in the model. The uppermost mantle beneath the western United States is principally composed of four large-scale shear wave velocity features, but lower crustal velocity structure exhibits far greater heterogeneity. We argue that these lower crustal structures are predominantly caused by interactions with the uppermost mantle, including the intrusion and underplating of mafic mantle materials and the thermal depression of wave speeds caused by conductive heating from the mantle. Upper and middle crustal wave speeds are generally correlated, and notable anomalies are inferred to result from terrane accretion at the continental margin and volcanic intrusions.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic formulation of inverse problems leads to the definition of a probability distribution in the model space. This probability distribution combines a priori information with new information obtained by measuring some observable parameters (data). As, in the general case, the theory linking data with model parameters is nonlinear, the a posteriori probability in the model space may not be easy to describe (it may be multimodal, some moments may not be defined, etc.). When analyzing an inverse problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model is usually not sufficient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case we may have a large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models in such a way that information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available. The most well known importance sampling method, the Metropolis algorithm, can be generalized, and this gives a method that allows analysis of (possibly highly nonlinear) inverse problems with complex a priori information and data with an arbitrary noise distribution.},

This results in an order of magnitude reduction in simulation time from the order of 1 s for FD modelling to the order of 0.1 s using our approach. Such a speed improvement could lead to real-time seismic simulation applications and benefit seismic inversion algorithms based on forward modelling, such as full waveform inversion.

Whilst PINNs have been successfully applied across many physical systems, the wave equation presents unique challenges due to the multi-scale, propagating and oscillatory nature of its solutions, and it is unclear how well they perform in this setting. We use a deep neural network to learn solutions of the wave equation, using the wave equation and a boundary condition as direct constraints in the loss function when training the network. We test the approach by solving the 2D acoustic wave equation for spatially-varying velocity models of increasing complexity, including homogeneous, layered and Earth-realistic models, and find the network is able to accurately simulate the wavefield across these cases. By using the physics constraint in the loss function the network is able to solve for the wavefield far outside of its boundary training data, offering a way to reduce the generalisation issues of existing deep learning approaches. We extend the approach for the Earth-realistic case by conditioning the network on the source location and find that it is able to generalise over this initial condition, removing the need to retrain the network for each solution. In contrast to traditional numerical simulation this approach is very efficient when computing arbitrary space-time points in the wavefield, as once trained the network carries out inference in a single step without needing to compute the entire wavefield. We discuss the potential applications, limitations and further research directions of this work.},

We introduce a methodology that allows construction of joint models with various levels of scaling complexity (\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} = dln \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend/dln vS, \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} = dln vS/dln vP), in order to detect seismological signatures of chemical heterogeneity. We demonstrate that the data sets considered cannot be fit concurrently with a uniform \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} or a positive and uniform \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} throughout the mantle. The variance reductions to P wave travel times and vP-sensitive modes are up to 40\% higher with our preferred model of anisotropic shear and compressional velocity than the recent anisotropic shear velocity model S362ANI+M, which was constructed assuming a uniform \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} throughout the mantle. Several features reported in earlier tomographic studies persist after the inclusion of new and larger data sets; anticorrelation between bulk sound and shear velocities in the lowermost mantle as well as an increase in \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} with depth in the lower mantle are largely independent of the regularization scheme. When correlations between density and shear velocity variations are imposed in the lowermost mantle, variance reductions of several spheroidal and toroidal modes deteriorate by as much as 40\%. Recent measurements of the splitting of 0S2, in particular, are largely incompatible with perfectly correlated shear velocity and density heterogeneity throughout the mantle. A way to significantly improve the fits to various data sets is by allowing independent density perturbations in the lowermost mantle. Our preferred joint model consists of denser-than-average anomalies ({$\sim$}1\% peak to peak) at the base of the mantle roughly coincident with the low-velocity superplumes. The relative variation of shear velocity, density, and compressional velocity in our study disfavors a purely thermal contribution to heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle, with implications for the long-term stability and evolution of superplumes.},

  abstract = {Tomography is one of the cornerstones of geophysics, enabling detailed spatial descriptions of otherwise invisible processes. However, due to the fundamental ill-posedness of tomography problems, the choice of parametrizations and regularizations for inversion significantly affect the result. Parametrizations for geophysical tomography typically reflect the mathematical structure of the inverse problem. We propose, instead, to parametrize the tomographic inverse problem using a geologically motivated approach. We build a model from explicit geological units that reflect the a priori knowledge of the problem. To solve the resulting large-scale nonlinear inverse problem, we employ the efficient Ensemble Kalman Inversion scheme, a highly parallelizable, iteratively regularizing optimizer that uses the ensemble Kalman filter to perform a derivative-free approximation of the general iteratively regularized Levenberg\textendash Marquardt method. The combination of a model specification framework that explicitly encodes geological structure and a robust, derivative-free optimizer enables the solution of complex inverse problems involving non-differentiable forward solvers and significant a priori knowledge. We illustrate the model specification framework using synthetic and real data examples of near-surface seismic tomography using the factored eikonal fast marching method as a forward solver for first arrival traveltimes. The geometrical and level set framework allows us to describe geophysical hypotheses in concrete terms, and then optimize and test these hypotheses, helping us to answer targeted geophysical questions.},

  abstract = {The problem of decomposing irregular data on the sphere into a set of spherical harmonics is common in many fields of geosciences where it is necessary to build a quantitative understanding of a globally varying field. For example, in global seismology, a compressional or shear wave speed that emerges from tomographic images is used to interpret current state and composition of the mantle, and in geomagnetism, secular variation of magnetic field intensity measured at the surface is studied to better understand the changes in the Earth's core. Optimization methods are widely used for spherical harmonic analysis of irregular data, but they typically do not treat the dependence of the uncertainty estimates on the imposed regularization. This can cause significant difficulties in interpretation, especially when the best-fit model requires more variables as a result of underestimating data noise. Here, with the above limitations in mind, the problem of spherical harmonic expansion of irregular data is treated within the hierarchical Bayesian framework. The hierarchical approach significantly simplifies the problem by removing the need for regularization terms and user-supplied noise estimates. The use of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion for picking the optimal maximum degree of spherical harmonic expansion and the resulting spherical harmonic analyses are first illustrated on a noisy synthetic data set. Subsequently, the method is applied to two global data sets sensitive to the Earth's inner core and lowermost mantle, consisting of PKPab-df and PcP-P differential traveltime residuals relative to a spherically symmetric Earth model. The posterior probability distributions for each spherical harmonic coefficient are calculated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling; the uncertainty obtained for the coefficients thus reflects the noise present in the real data and the imperfections in the spherical harmonic expansion.},

We present a strategy for efficiently solving hierarchical Bayesian geophysical inverse problems for fixed parametrizations using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, and highlight an effective methodology for determining optimal parametrizations from a set of candidates by using efficient approximations to leave-one-out cross-validation for model complexity. To illustrate these methods, we use a case study of differential traveltime tomography of the lowermost mantle, using short period P-wave data carefully selected to minimize the contributions of the upper mantle and inner core. The resulting tomographic image of the lowermost mantle has a relatively weak degree 2\textemdash instead there is substantial heterogeneity at all low spherical harmonic degrees less than 15. This result further reinforces the dichotomy in the lowermost mantle between relatively simple degree 2 dominated long-period S-wave tomographic models, and more complex short-period P-wave tomographic models.},

The continuous data of 222 permanent broadband stations of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) were used in production of noise cross-correlation waveforms, resulting in a spatially dense set of measurements for the southern California region in the 1\textendash 15 s period band. The fine interstation spacing of the SCSN allows retrieval of high signal-to-noise ratio Rayleigh waves at periods as low as 1 s, significantly improving the vertical resolution of the resulting tomographic image, compared to previous studies with minimum periods of 5\textendash 10 s. In addition, horizontal resolution is naturally improved by increased station density. Tectonic subregions including the Los Angeles basin and Salton trough are clearly visible due to their high short-period H/V ratios, whereas the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges exhibit low H/V at all periods.},

We propose a split processing scheme based on a wavelet transform in time and pre-conditioned curvelet-based compressive sensing in space to create a sparse representation of the continuous seismic wavefield with smooth second-order derivatives. Using this representation, we illustrate several applications, including surface wave gradiometry, Helmholtz\textendash Hodge decomposition of the wavefield into irrotational and solenoidal components, and compression and denoising of seismic records.},

However, each DAS channel is sensitive only to one projection of the horizontal strain tensor and therefore gives an incomplete picture of the horizontal seismic wavefield, limiting our ability to make a holistic analysis of instrument response. This analysis has therefore been largely restricted to pointwise comparisons where a fortuitious coincidence of reference three-component seismometers and colocated DAS cable allows. We evaluate DAS instrument response by comparing DAS measurements from the PoroTomo experiment with strain-rate wavefield reconstructed from the nodal seismic array deployed in the same experiment, allowing us to treat the entire DAS array in a systematic fashion irrespective of cable geometry relative to the location of nodes. We found that, while the phase differences are in general small, the amplitude differences between predicted and observed DAS strain rates average a factor of 2 across the array and correlate with near-surface geology, suggesting that careful assessment of DAS deployments is essential for applications that require reliable assessments of amplitude. We further discuss strategies for empirical gain corrections and optimal placement of point sensor deployments to generate the best combined sensitivity with an already deployed DAS cable, from a wavefield reconstruction perspective.},

PSHA rests on assumptions now known to conflict with earthquake physics; many damaging earthquakes, including the 1988 Spitak, Armenia, event and the 2011 Tohoku, Japan, event, have occurred in regions relatively rated low-risk by PSHA hazard maps. No extant method, including PSHA, produces reliable estimates of seismic hazard. Earthquake hazard mitigation should be recognized to be inherently political, involving a tradeoff between uncertain costs and uncertain risks. Earthquake scientists, engineers, and risk managers can make important contributions to the hard problem of allocating limited resources wisely, but government officials and stakeholders must take responsibility for the risks of accidents due to natural events that exceed the adopted safety criteria.},

Previous studies found various percentages of isotropic components of the seismic moment tensor (MT), which opens up an important question about the reliability of the methods and assumptions we routinely use to recover the seismic MT in the point source approximation. Of particular interest is the data noise model that can be utilized to represent the uncertainty associated with the recorded data. If the noise is not accounted for, this may result in a range of unwanted effects such as overfitting waveform data, and, in turn, it may lead to erroneous conclusions. We thus scrutinize the analyses of the seismic MTof this explosion by performing a thorough analysis of the source depth and time utilizing newly developed Earth structure models to invert seismograms at regional distances at different frequency bands. In addition, we estimate the solution uncertainty within a hierarchical Bayesian framework that allows accounting for noise in the data. Our results show that the resulting MT of this event contains an expectedly large isotropic component (about 70\%) and a dip-slip faulting.},

The method is designed for point source inversion using waveform data of moderate-size earthquakes and explosions at regional distances. This probabilistic approach results in an ensemble of models, whose density is proportional to parameter probability distribution and quantifies parameter uncertainties. Furthermore, we invert for noise in the data, allowing it to determine the model complexity. We implement an empirical noise covariance matrix that accounts for interdependence of observational errors present in waveform data. After we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on synthetic data, we apply it to a Long Valley Caldera, CA, earthquake with a well-documented anomalous (non-double-couple) radiation from previous studies.

  abstract = {We formulate the multiple-event seismic location problem as a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model (BAYHLoc). This statistical model has three distinct components: traveltime predictions, arrival-time measurements, and an a priori statistical model for each aspect of the multipleevent problem. The traveltime model is multifaceted, including both phase-specific adjustments to traveltime curves to improve broad-area prediction, as well as path/phase-specific traveltime adjustments. The arrival-time measurement model is decomposed into station, phase, and event components, allowing flexibility and physically interpretable error parameters. The prior model allows all available information to be brought to bear on the multiple event system. Prior knowledge on the probabilistic accuracy of event locations, traveltime predictions, and arrivaltime measurements can be specified. Bayesian methodology merges all three components of the hierarchical model into a joint probability formulation. The joint posterior distribution is, in essence, an inference of all parameters given the prior constraints, self-consistency of the data set, and physics of traveltime calculation. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to draw realizations from the joint posterior distribution. The resulting samples can be used to estimate marginal distributions, for example epicentres and probability regions, as well as parameter correlations. We demonstrate BAYHLoc using the set of Nevada Test Site nuclear explosions, for which hypocentres are known, and phase measurements and traveltimes are well characterized. We find significant improvement in epicentre accuracy using BAYHLoc. Much of the improvement is attributed to the adaptive arrival-time measurement model, which controls data weighting. Regardless of the initial traveltime model, the use of an adjustment to the traveltime curves produces a level of epicentre accuracy that is generally achieved only through meticulous analysis and data culling. Further, we find that accurate hypocentres (including depth and origin-time) are achieved when either accurate traveltime curves with tight priors are used, or when prior information on a small subset of events is utilized.},

Using this approach phase-label error can be accessed and phase-label error is propagated to all other multiple-event parameters. We test the method using a ground-truth data set of nuclear explosions at the Nevada Test Site. We find that posteriori phase labels agree with the meticulously analysed data set in more than 97 per cent of instances and the results are robust even when the input phase-label information is discarded. Only when a large percentage of the arrival-time data are corrupted does prior phase label information improve resolution of multiple-event parameters.

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of thermo-chemical, multi-phase, compressible mantle convection in a threedimensional spherical shell are used to investigate the relationship between lateral variations in seismic shear-wave velocity Vs above the core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB) and lateral variations in heat flux across the CMB (qCMB), when compositional variations and the post-perovskite phase transition are included. For simple thermal convection, the Vs\textendash qCMB relationship is reasonably but not perfectly linear. The post-perovskite transition introduces a non-linearity that amplifies fast Vs anomalies in cold regions, but there is still a unique mapping between {$\delta$}Vs and qCMB. Lateral variations in composition such as piles of dense material introduce another non-linearity that affects hot upwelling regions, and introduces a non-uniqueness in {$\delta$}Vs\textendash qCMB if the dense material (e.g., MORB) is seismically fast compared to the surrounding material. In this case, dense piles are ringed by sharp, low-Vs anomalies. If the CMB is covered by a global dense layer than variations in {$\delta$}Vs and qCMB are reduced but so is the mean value of qCMB. In all cases, the peak-to-peak lateral variation in qCMB is similar to or larger than twice the mean value, which might create problems for generating a dynamo according to existing numerical dynamo simulations. Analytical scalings are developed to explain the observed trends.},

  abstract = {We retrieve P diving waves by applying seismic interferometry to ambient-noise records observed at Long Beach, California, and invert travel times of these waves to estimate 3-D P wave velocity structure. The ambient noise is recorded by a 2-D dense and large network, which has about 2500 receivers with 100 m spacing. Compared to surface wave extraction, body wave extraction is a much greater challenge because ambient noise is typically dominated by surface wave energy. For each individual receiver pair, the cross-correlation function obtained from ambient-noise data does not show clear body waves. Although we can reconstruct body waves when we stack correlation functions over all receiver pairs, we need to extract body waves at each receiver pair separately for imaging spatial heterogeneity of subsurface structure. Therefore, we employ two filters after correlation to seek body waves between individual receiver pairs. The first filter is a selection filter based on the similarity between each correlation function and the stacked function. After selecting traces containing stronger body waves, we retain about two million correlation functions (35\% of all correlation functions) and successfully preserve most of body wave energy in the retained traces. The second filter is a noise suppression filter to enhance coherent energy (body waves here) and suppress incoherent noise in each trace. After applying these filters, we can reconstruct clear body waves from each virtual source. As an application of using extracted body waves, we estimate 3-D P wave velocities from these waves with travel time tomography. This study is the first body wave tomography result obtained from only ambient noise recorded at the ground surface. The velocity structure estimated from body waves has higher resolution than estimated from surface waves.},

  abstract = {The application of ambient seismic noise cross-correlation to distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data recorded by subsurface fiber-optic cables has revolutionized our ability to obtain high-resolution seismic images of the shallow subsurface. However, passive surface-wave imaging using DAS arrays is often restricted to Rayleigh-wave imaging and 2D imaging along straight segments of DAS arrays due to the intrinsic sensitivity of DAS being limited to axial strain along the cable for the most common type of fiber. We develop the concept of estimating empirical surface waves from mixed-sensor cross-correlation of velocity noise recorded by three-component seismometers and strain-rate noise recorded by DAS arrays. Using conceptual arguments and synthetic tests, we demonstrate that these cross-correlations converge to empirical surface-wave axial strain response at the DAS arrays for virtual single step forces applied at the seismometers. Rotating the three orthogonal components of the seismometer to a tangential\textendash radial\textendash vertical reference frame with respect to each DAS channel permits separate analysis of Rayleigh waves and Love waves for a medium that is sufficiently close to 1D and isotropic. We also develop and validate expressions that facilitate the measurement of surface-wave phase velocity on these noise cross-correlations at farfield distances using frequency\textendash time analysis. These expressions can also be used for DAS surface-wave records of active sources at local distances. We demonstrate the recovery of both Rayleigh waves and Love waves in noise cross-correlations derived from a dark fiber DAS array in the Sacramento basin, northern California, and nearby permanent seismic stations at frequencies {$\sim$} 0:1\textendash 0:2 Hz, up to distances of {$\sim$} 80 km. The phase-velocity dispersion measured on these noise cross-correlations are consistent with those measured on traditional noise cross-correlations for seismometer pairs. Our results extend the application of DAS to 3D ambient noise Rayleigh-wave and Love-wave tomography using seismometers surrounding a DAS array.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

Computations for large three-dimensional models become expensive requiring the use of efficient parallel solvers. We present new parallel implementations of the fast sweeping and locking sweeping methods optimized for shared memory systems such as multicore CPUs; we call them block fast sweeping method (BFSM) and block locking sweeping method (BLSM). Proposed methods are based on the domain decomposition approach with a special attention paid to high efficiency of the cache utilization and task execution synchronization. Performance tests on realistic models show high parallel efficiency of 85\textendash 95\% on modern multicore CPUs and require the same number of iterations to converge as do the serial sweeping methods. We also highlight the importance of properly selecting the stopping criterion in the iterative sweeping methods aiming for a balance between computational time and accuracy of the result required by an application. In particular, we show that in seismic applications one can reach reasonable accuracy of computed travel times while dramatically reducing the number of iterations compared to the case of using the full convergence stopping criterion.},

The sources are decomposed into their monopole, dipole and quadrupole constituents, with known azimuthal radiation patterns. The full 3-D response and, therefore, the 3-D waveform sensitivity kernel for an arbitrary source-receiver geometry, can be reconstructed from a series of six independent 2-D solutions, which may be obtained using a spectral-element or other mesh-based numerical method on a 2-D, planar, semicircular domain. This divide-and-conquer, 3-D to 2-D reduction strategy can be used to compute sensitivity kernels for any seismic phase, including grazing and diffracted waves, at relatively low computational cost.},

  abstract = {Stress drop, a measure of static stress change in earthquakes, is the subject of numerous investigations. Stress drop in an earthquake is likely to be spatially varying over the fault, creating a stress drop distribution. Representing this spatial distribution by a single number, as commonly done, implies averaging in space. In this study, we investigate similarities and differences between three different averages of the stress drop distribution used in earthquake studies. The first one, {$\sigma$} M , is the commonly estimated stress drop based on the seismic moment and fault geometry/dimensions. It is known that {$\sigma$} M corresponds to averaging the stress drop distribution with the slip distribution due to uniform stress drop as the weighting function. The second one, {$\sigma$} A, is the simplest (unweighted) average of the stress drop distribution over the fault, equal to the difference between the average stress levels on the fault before and after an earthquake. The third one, {$\sigma$} E , enters discussions of energy partitioning and radiation efficiency; we show that it corresponds to averaging the stress drop distribution with the actual final slip at each point as the weighting function. The three averages, {$\sigma$} M , {$\sigma$} A, and {$\sigma$} E , are often used interchangeably in earthquake studies and simply called `stress drop'. Yet they are equal to each other only for ruptures with spatially uniform stress drop, which results in an elliptical slip distribution for a circular rupture. Indeed, we find that other relatively simple slip shapes\textemdash such as triangular, trapezoidal or sinusoidal\textemdash already result in stress drop distributions with notable differences between {$\sigma$} M , {$\sigma$} A, and {$\sigma$} E . Introduction of spatial slip heterogeneity results in further systematic differences between them, with {$\sigma$} E always being larger than {$\sigma$} M , a fact that we have proven theoretically, and {$\sigma$} A almost always being the smallest. In particular, the value of the energy-related {$\sigma$} E significantly increases in comparison to the moment-based {$\sigma$} M with increasing roughness of the slip distribution over the fault. Previous studies used {$\sigma$} M in place of {$\sigma$} E in computing the radiation ratio {$\eta$}R that compares the radiated energy in earthquakes to a characteristic part of their strain energy change. Typical values of {$\eta$}R for large earthquakes were found to be from 0.25 to 1. Our finding that {$\sigma$} E {$\geq$} {$\sigma$} M allows us to interpret the values of {$\eta$}R as the upper bound. We determine the restrictions placed by such estimates on the evolution of stress with slip at the earthquake source. We also find that {$\sigma$} E can be approximated by {$\sigma$} M if the latter is computed based on a reduced rupture area.},

The phase boundaries of (Mg,Fe)(2)SiO4 in the mantle transition zone are modified under the wet conditions by changes in thermodynamic properties of its polymorphs because of differences in the water solubilities of these minerals. The shift of phase boundaries has significant implications for the topography of the 410 km and 660 km seismic discontinuities. The post-perovskite phase with CaIrO3 Structure exists at pressures above 110 GPa and at high temperature. The effects of Al and Fe on phase transition are under debate. Several post-stishovite phases have been reported but equilibrium boundaries and existence in the real lower mantle are also still debatable. Spin transition occurs in magnesiowustite, perovskite, and post-perovskite phases at high pressures of the lower mantle and core. The pressure interval in the spin transition can be large at high temperature and so the transition might not cause a discrete change in physical properties under real Earth conditions.

  abstract = {We present a gravity-inversion method for estimating the geometry of an isolated 3-D source, assuming prior knowledge about its top and density contrast. The subsurface region containing the geological sources is discretized into an ensemble of 3-D vertical prisms juxtaposed in the vertical direction of a right-handed coordinate system. The prisms' thicknesses and density contrasts are known, but their horizontal cross-sections are described by unknown polygons. The horizontal coordinates of the polygon vertices approximately represent the edges of horizontal depth slices of the 3-D geological source. The polygon vertices of each prism are described by polar coordinates with an unknown origin within the prism. Our method estimates the horizontal Cartesian coordinates of the unknown origin and the radii associated with the vertices of each polygon for a fixed number of equally spaced central angles from 0o to 360o. By estimating these parameters from gravity data, we retrieve a set of vertically stacked prisms with polygonal horizontal sections that represents a set of juxtaposed horizontal depth slices of the estimated source. This set, therefore, approximates the 3-D source's geometry. To obtain stable estimates we impose constraints on the source shape. The judicious use of first-order Tikhonov regularization on either all or a few parameters allows estimating both vertical and inclined sources whose shapes can be isometric or anisometric. The estimated solution, despite being stable and fitting the data, will depend on the maximum depth assumed for the set of juxtaposed 3-D prisms. To reduce the class of possible solutions compatible with the gravity anomaly and the constraints, we use a criterion based on the relationship between the datamisfit measure and the estimated total-anomalous mass computed along successive inversions, using different tentative maximum depths for the set of assumed juxtaposed 3-D prisms. In applying this criterion, we plotted the curve of the estimated total-anomalous mass mt versus data-misfit measure s for the range of different tentative maximum depths. The tentative value for the maximum depth producing the smallest value of data-misfit measure in the mt \texttimes s curve is the best estimate of the true (or minimum) depth to the bottom of the source, depending on whether the true source produces a gravity anomaly that is able (or not) to resolve the depth to the source bottom. This criterion was theoretically deduced from Gauss' theorem. Tests with synthetic data shows that the correct depth-to-bottom estimate of the source is obtained if the minimum of s on the mt \texttimes{} s curve is well defined; otherwise this criterion provides just a lower bound estimate of the source's depth to the bottom. These synthetic results show that the method efficiently recovers source geometries dipping at different angles. Test on real data from the Matsitama intrusive complex (Botswana) retrieved a dipping intrusion with variable dips and strikes and with bottom depth of 8.0 {$\pm$} 0.5 km.},

The results are averaged over several magnetic diffusion times to delineate the steady-state magnetic field and fluid motion. When the boundary heat flow is uniform the time-averaged flow approaches axisymmetry and the magnetic field is mostly a geocentric axial dipole (GAD). The largest departure from GAD in this case is the octupole field component. When the amplitude of the boundary heat flow heterogeneity exceeds the average heat flow, the dynamos usually fail. Lesser amounts of boundary heterogeneity produce stable dynamos with time-averaged magnetic fields that depend on the form of the boundary heterogeneity. Elevated heat flow in the northern hemisphere produces a time-averaged axial quadrupole magnetic field comparable to the inferred paleomagnetic quadrupole. Azimuthally periodic boundary heat flow produces a time-averaged magnetic field component with the same azimuthal wavenumber, shifted in longitude relative to the heat flow pattern. Anomalously high and anomalously low magnetic flux density correlate with downwellings and upwellings, respectively, in the time-averaged fluid motion. A dynamo with boundary heat flow derived from lower-mantle seismic tomography produces anomalous magnetic flux patches at high latitudes and westward fluid velocity in one hemisphere, generally consistent with the present-day structure of the geodynamo.},

  abstract = {Ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) are small-scale structures with a sharp decrease in S and P wave velocity, and an increase in the density on the top of the Earth's core-mantle boundary. The ratio of S and P wave velocity reduction and density anomaly are important to understanding whether ULVZs consist of partial melt or chemically distinct material. However, existing methods such as forward waveform modeling that utilize 1-D and 2-D Earth-structure models face challenges when trying to uniquely quantify ULVZ properties because of inherent nonuniqueness and nonlinearity. This paper develops a Bayesian inversion for ULVZ parameters and uncertainties with rigorous noise treatment to address these challenges. The posterior probability density of the ULVZ parameters (the solution to the inverse problem) is sampled by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To improve sampling efficiency, parallel tempering is applied by simulating a sequence of tempered Markov chains in parallel and allowing information exchange between chains. First, the Bayesian inversion is applied to simulated noisy data for a realistic ULVZ model. Then, measured data sampling the lowermost mantle under the Philippine Sea are considered. Cluster analysis and visual waveform inspection suggest that two distinct classes of ScP (S waves converted to, and reflected as, P waves) waves exist in this region. The distinct waves likely correspond to lateral variability in the lowermost mantle properties in a NE-SW direction. For the NE area, Bayesian model selection identifies a two-layer model with a gradual density increase as a function of depth as optimal. This complex ULVZ structure can be due to the percolation of iron-enriched, molten material in the lowermost mantle. The results for the SW area are more difficult to interpret, which may be due to the limited number of data available (too few waveforms to appropriately reduce noise) and/or complex 2-D and 3-D structures that cannot be explained properly by the 1-D models required by our inversion approach. In particular, the complex waveforms require highly layered 1-D models to fit the data. These models appear physically unreasonable and suggest that the SW region cannot be explained by 1-D structure.},

  abstract = {Predicting on circular domains is a central issue in many industrial fields such as microelectronics and environmental engineering. In this context Gaussian process (GP) regression is used, coupled with Zernike polynomials. However, usual GP models do not take into account the geometry of the disk in their covariance structure (or kernel), which may be a drawback at least for technological or physical processes involving a rotation or a diffusion from the center of the disk. For that purpose, we introduce so-called polar GPs defined on the non-Euclidian space of polar coordinates. Their kernels are obtained as a combination of a kernel for the radius using an Euclidean distance, and a kernel for the angle, based on either chordal or geodesic distances on the unit circle. Their efficiency is illustrated on two industrial applications where radial and angular patterns are visible. In a second time, the problem of defining an initial design of experiment (DoE) for circular domains is considered. Two new Latin hypercube designs are obtained, by defining a valid maximin criterion for polar coordinates. Their robustness in prediction is assessed and compared to other DoEs over a range of various toy functions and models.},

To accurately model the long-period response of Europa, we use normal modes calculated from physically self-consistent models of Europa's structure developed in part 1 (Cammarano et al., 2007). On the basis of the geometry of observed faults, we estimate that faulting events of magnitude 5 or larger may occur regularly. Synthetic seismograms show that long-period displacement measurements with millimeter accuracy could detect current tectonic activity and determine the thickness of Europa's ice shell, and confirm the presence of a subsurface ocean. Determination of deeper structure with seismic measurements, however, is more challenging in the presence of a global liquid ocean, which acts to decouple deeper seismic energy from the surface.},

  abstract = {We deployed a dense seismic array to image the shallow structure in the injection area of the Brady Hot Springs geothermal power plant in western Nevada. The array was composed of 238 threecomponent, 5 Hz nodal instruments, 8700 m of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fiber-optic cable (FOC) installed horizontally in surface trenches, and 400 m of FOC installed vertically in a borehole. The geophone array had about 60 m instrument spacing in the target zone, whereas DAS channel separations were about 1 m with an averaging (gauge) length of 10 m. The acquisition systems provided 15 days of continuous records, including active-source and ambient noise signals. A large vibroseis truck was operated at 196 locations, exciting a swept-frequency signal from 5 to 80 Hz over 20 s using three vibration modes (vertical, longitudinal, and transverse), with three sweeps per mode at each site. Sweeps were repeated up to four times at each site during four different stages of power plant operation: normal operation, shutdown, high and oscillatory injection and production, and normal operation. After removal of the sweep signal from the raw data, the first P-wave arrivals were automatically picked using a combination of methods. The travel times were then used to invert for the 3D P-wave velocity structure. Models with 100 m horizontal and 20\textendash 50 m vertical node spacing were obtained, covering an area 2000 m by 1300 m, with acceptable resolution extending to about 250 m below surface. The travel-time data were fit to a root mean square (rms) misfit of 31 ms, close to our estimated picking uncertainty. Lateral boundaries between high and low velocity zones agree relatively well with the location of local faults from previous studies, and low near-surface velocities are associated with faults and fumarole locations. A sharp increase in velocity from {$<$} 1500 to {$>$} 2000 m=s at approximately 50 m below the ground surface in many parts of the study area may indicate a shallower water table than expected for the region.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of the dispersive phase and group velocities having sensible physical meaning is of practical importance in various NDT techniques. In this paper, we propose a method based on the harmonic wavelet transform to evaluate dispersive phase and group velocities. To apply the harmonic wavelet transform in the evaluation of dispersive velocity, the meaning of the harmonic wavelet coef\textregistered cient is interpreted from a different point of view. Based on these concepts, the step-by-step procedure to evaluate the dispersive phase and group velocities was proposed. In the proposed method, both phase and group velocities can be obtained directly from information extracted from data based on the harmonic wavelet transform. To evaluate the validity of the proposed method, numerical simulations of the multi-layered system were performed and the phase and group velocities determined by the proposed method match very well with theoretical velocities showing the good potential of the proposed method. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The P-wave polarization direction is only sensitive to shear wave speed but not to compressional wave speed, while the S-wave polarization direction is sensitive to both wave speeds. The technique is applied to data from the High-Sensitivity Seismograph Network in Japan, and the results show that the wave speed estimates obtained from polarization analysis are compatible with those from borehole measurements. The lateral variations in wave speeds correlate with geological and physical features such as topography and volcanoes. The technique requires minimal computation resources, and can be used on any number of three-component teleseismic recordings, opening opportunities for non-invasive and inexpensive study of the shallowest ({$\sim$}100 m) crustal structures.},

  abstract = {Magma degassing fundamentally controls the Earth's volatile cycles. The large amount of gas expelled into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions (i.e., volcanic outgassing) is the most obvious display of magmatic volatile release. However, owing to the large intrusive:extrusive ratio, and considering the paucity of volatiles left in intrusive rocks after final solidification, volcanic outgassing likely constitutes only a small fraction of the overall mass of magmatic volatiles released to the Earth's surface. Therefore, as most magmas stall on their way to the surface, outgassing of uneruptible, crystal-rich magma storage regions will play a dominant role in closing the balance of volatile element cycling between the mantle and the surface. We use a numerical approach to study the migration of a magmatic volatile phase (MVP) in crystal-rich magma bodies (``mush zones'') at the pore scale. Our results suggest that buoyancy-driven outgassing is efficient over crystal volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.7 (for mm-sized crystals). We parameterize our porescale results for MVP migration in a thermomechanical magma reservoir model to study outgassing under dynamical conditions where cooling controls the evolution of the proportion of crystal, gas, and melt phases and to investigate the role of the reservoir size and the temperature-dependent viscoelastic response of the crust on outgassing efficiency. We find that buoyancy-driven outgassing allows for a maximum of 40\textendash 50\% volatiles to leave the reservoir over the 0.4\textendash 0.7 crystal volume fractions, implying that a significant amount of outgassing must occur at high crystal content ({$>$}0.7) through veining and/or capillary fracturing.},

In theory, this rapid carbon release should have severely acidified the surface ocean, though no geochemical evidence has yet been presented. Using boron-based proxies for surface ocean carbonate chemistry, we present the first observational evidence for a drop in the pH of surface and thermocline seawater during the PETM. Planktic foraminifers from a drill site in the North Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1209) show a similar to 0.8\% decrease in boron isotopic composition (delta B-11) at the onset of the event, along with a 30-40\% reduction in shell B/Ca. Similar trends in delta B-11 are present in two lower-resolution records from the South Atlantic and Equatorial Pacific. These observations are consistent with significant, global acidification of the surface ocean lasting at least 70 kyr and requiring sustained carbon release. The anomalies in the B records are consistent with an initial surface pH drop of similar to 0.3 units, at the upper range of model-based estimates of acidification.},

To speed up the computation of kernels, so that it is practical to formulate the inverse problem also with respect to a laterally heterogeneous starting model, we calculate them via the adjoint method, based on backpropagation, and parallelize our software on a Linux cluster. Our method is a step forward from ray theory, as it surpasses the inherent infinite-frequency approximation. It differs from analytical Born theory in that it does not involve a far-field approximation, and accounts, in principle, for non-linear effects like multiple scattering and wave front healing. It is much cheaper than the more accurate, fully 3-D numerical solution of the Earth's equations of motion, which has not yet been applied to large-scale tomography. Our tomographic results and trade-off analysis are compatible with those found in the ray- and analytical-Born-theory approaches.},

  abstract = {Cross correlation of seismograms provides new information on the Earth both through the exploitation of ambient noise and specific components of earthquake records. Here we cross-correlate recordings of large earthquakes on a planetary scale and identify a range of hitherto unobserved seismic phases in Earth's correlation wavefield. We show that both arrivals with the timing expected for the regular seismic wavefield and previously unexplained phases are produced by interference between seismic paths having the same ray parameter but with only a subset of propagation legs in common. This insight explains the origin and generation mechanism of the features of Earth's correlation wavefield and opens up new ways of addressing issues in global seismology. Strong similarity between observed and synthesized correlation wavefields indicates that the Earth's radial structure is remarkably well constrained in the intermediate period range. Plain Language Summary We investigate the nature of earthquake coda waveform cross correlations and provide an explanation for the origin of, what we term here, the Earth's correlation wavefield. This consists of numerous correlated signals some that appear similar to regular seismic phases and others not apparent in the conventional seismic wavefield. The nature of the correlation wavefield described here has far-reaching implications for the field of seismology. In particular, we show that the correlated wavefield illuminates the Earth's interior in an entirely new and unexpected manner. With further method developments we expect this to lead to improved structural constraints on the Earth interior, especially in the poorly sampled regions such as the Earth's lowermost mantle and core.},

In aluminum-bearing compositions relevant to Earth's mantle, iron concentration in silicates drops above 70 GPa before increasing up to 110 GPa with a minimum at 85 GPa; it then dramatically drops in the postperovskite stability field above 116 GPa. This compositional variation should strengthen the lowermost mantle between 1,800 km depth and 2,000 km depth, and weaken it between 2,000 km depth and the D" layer. The succession of layers could dynamically decouple the mantle above 2,000 km from the lowermost mantle, and provide a rheological basis for the stabilization and nonentrainment of large low-shear-velocity provinces below that depth.},

  abstract = {The M7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake generated good quality strong motion data  on a broad distance range. These data are very useful for testing kinematic rupture generators for strong ground motion simulations of crustal earthquakes in California. In order to investigate the performance of the GP kinematic rupture generator in simulating the recorded ground motion we used the GP to generate a rupture model for the Ridgecrest earthquake. Our model contains a large slip patch that overlaps the background slip. Both the background and large slip areas contain correlated small-scale random slip variations. The location of the large slip patch was constrained by the slip distribution obtained from slip inversions (Dreger 2019). The near-fault (distance {$<$}30km) ground motion was computed using a hybrid method that computes the low frequency and high frequency parts separately, using deterministic and stochastic schemes, respectively. The low frequency part ({$<$} 1Hz) was computed using the FK method and a 1D regional velocity model with a Vs30=500 m/s. Finally the synthetic broad-band acceleration time histories were corrected for site effects using empirical site corrections based on the local Vs30. Using several realizations of the earthquake rupture, we investigated the sensitivity of near-fault ground motion to GP rupture generator parameters, in particular, depth of large slip area, and default parameters such as rise time scaling with slip and depth, and correlation between spatial variations of slip and rise time. In our presentation we will show results of our investigation.

  abstract = {We present a new three-dimensional model of the major fault systems in southern California. The model describes the San Andreas fault and associated strikeslip fault systems in the eastern California shear zone and Peninsular Ranges, as well as active blind-thrust and reverse faults in the Los Angeles basin and Transverse Ranges. The model consists of triangulated surface representations (t-surfs) of more than 140 active faults that are defined based on surfaces traces, seismicity, seismic reflection profiles, wells, and geologic cross sections and models. The majority of earthquakes, and more than 95\% of the regional seismic moment release, occur along faults represented in the model. This suggests that the model describes a comprehensive set of major earthquake sources in the region. The model serves the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) as a unified resource for physics-based fault systems modeling, strong ground-motion prediction, and probabilistic seismic hazards assessment.},

  abstract = {Moulins are important conduits for surface meltwater to reach the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet. It has been proposed that in a warming climate, newly formed moulins associated with the inland migration of supraglacial lakes could introduce surface melt to new regions of the bed, introducing or enhancing sliding there. By examining surface strain rates, we found that the upper limit to where crevasses, and therefore moulins, are likely to form is similar to 1600m. This is also roughly the elevation above which lakes do not drain completely. Thus, meltwater above this elevation will largely flow tens of kilometers through surface streams into existing moulins downstream. Furthermore, results from a thermal ice sheet model indicate that the similar to 1600m crevassing limit is well below the wet-frozen basal transition (similar to 2000m). Together, these data sets suggest that new supraglacial lakes will have a limited effect on the inland expansion of melt-induced seasonal acceleration.},

At present, it is difficult to test hypotheses put forward to explain seismic observations due to poor seismic coverage, as particular earthquake-station geometries are needed. We demonstrate here that seismic noise correlations can be used to robustly image deep-mantle reflections with larger stacked amplitudes of reflected waves compared with earthquake data. In a comparison between noise and earthquake data, we find that the arrival times and the slowness of reflected waves, both sampling a region beneath Siberia, agree with those for a reflector at 2530km depth, and the small amplitude reflections are sufficiently clear in the noise correlations to compare them reliably with synthetic data. Our data open exciting prospects for illuminating new target zones in the deep mantle to further constrain the dynamics and mineralogy of the deep Earth.},

  abstract = {The potential of continental low-angle normal faults (LANF) to nucleate large ({$>$}6.0 M-w) earthquakes at low-angles remains unclear despite much focused research. We document evidence for ancient seismicity along a continental LANF (detachment fault) that formed and slipped at low-angles and produced tectonic pseudotachylyte. These thick and laterally persistent pseudotachylyte accumulations along the West Salton detachment fault (WSDF), Salton Trough, USA, preserve convincing evidence for a frictional melt origin including: spherulitic microlites, ductile-flow structures, preservation of high temperature phases as clasts, and injection veins. Cumulative thickness of pseudotachylyte along the fault ranges from 0.1 to 1.5 m, and pseudotachylyte-cataclasite in the fault core and damage zone are exposed along similar to 2.6 km length of the fault. Reworked fragments of pseudotachylyte in cataclasites, and multiple generations of cataclasites provide evidence for the preservation of multiple earthquake cycles. The limited exposure ({$<$}3\% of the total exposed length), and unusually large volumes of pseudotachylyte along this section of the WSDF suggest special conditions for generation of frictional melt. Prior work, documenting the low dip of the WSDF throughout its history and abundant evidence for ancient seismicity presented here, shows that research must focus on explanations for LANF formation and slip that incorporate seismic slip. A new synthesis of pseudotachylyte along detachment faults from diverse tectonic settings provides convincing evidence that repeated ancient seismicity is common along detachment faults. These data constrain models for low-angle normal fault formation and strength. These results also have important implications for the evaluation of seismic hazards associated with active examples of LANF. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Unconsolidated, near-surface sediments can have a profound influence on the amplitudes and frequencies of ground shaking at a site during earthquakes, and these effects should be taken into account in seismic hazard assessments. This study explores methods to use teleseismic arrivals recorded on linear receiver arrays to characterize widespread shallow sedimentary deposits, including estimation of the velocities, determination of fundamental resonance peaks, and imaging of the major reflectors. The examples used are the extensive Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) and associated Mississippi embayment (ME) strata of the central and eastern United States. The large contrast in material properties at the bedrock surface beneath these sediments produces a strong fundamental resonance peak in the 0.1 Hz and above frequency range. The frequency of the fundamental peak is estimated here by computing spectral ratios at each receiver site relative to bedrock sites at the ends of the receiver arrays. Sediment thicknesses derived from published contour maps made from drill-hole data allow for estimation of average velocities to match the observed frequencies of resonance peaks with theoretical values at each receiver site, with the sloping bedrock surface allowing for computation of an average velocity versus depth function if horizontal layers are assumed. The velocity function is then used to convert the spectral ratios from frequency to depth, resulting in an image of the subsurface similar to that of a seismic reflection profile. The results demonstrate the use of teleseismic signals for characterizing and imaging shallow sedimentary strata on receiver arrays.},

  abstract = {Unrest at Long Valley caldera (California) during the past few decades has been attributed to the ascent of hydrothermal fluids or magma recharge. The difference is critical for assessing volcanic hazard. To better constrain subsurface structures in the upper crust and to help distinguish between these two competing hypotheses for the origin of unrest, we model the 3D seismic attenuation structure because attenuation is particularly sensitive to the presence of melt. We analyse more than 47 000 vertical component waveforms recorded from January 2000 through November 2016 obtained from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. We then inverted the S-to-coda energy ratios using the coda normalization method and obtained an average Q of 250. Low attenuation anomalies are imaged in the fluid-rich western and eastern areas of the caldera, one of which corresponds to the location of an earthquake swarm that occurred in 2014. From a comparison with other geophysical images (magnetotellurics, seismic tomography) we attribute the high attenuation anomalies to hydrothermal systems. Average to high attenuation values are also observed at Mammoth Mountain (southwest of the caldera), and may also have a hydrothermal origin. A large high attenuation anomaly within the caldera extends from the surface to the depths we can resolve at 9 km. Shallow rocks here are cold and this is where earthquakes occur. Together, these observations imply that the high attenuation region is not imaging a large magma body at shallow depths nor do we image any isolated high attenuation bodies in the upper {$\approx$}8 km that would be clear-cut evidence for partially molten bodies such as sills or other magma bodies.},

Seismic noise data in the period range 2 and 20 s recorded in year 2014 by 346 stations with \textasciitilde 1- to 30-km station spacing are analyzed. Rayleigh and Love wave phase travel times are measured using vertical-vertical and transverse-transverse noise cross correlations, and group travel times are derived from the phase measurements. Using the Eikonal equation for each location and period, isotropic phase and group velocities and 2-psi azimuthal anisotropy are determined statistically with measurements from different virtual sources. Starting with the SCEC Community Velocity Model, the observed 2.5- to 16-s isotropic phase and group dispersion curves are jointly inverted on a 0.05\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 0.05\textdegree{} grid to obtain local 1-D piecewise shear wave velocity (Vs) models. Compared to the starting model, the final results have generally lower Vs in the shallow crust (top 3\textendash 10 km), particularly in areas such as basins and fault zones. The results also show clear velocity contrasts across the San Andreas, San Jacinto, Elsinore, and Garlock Faults and suggest that the San Andreas Fault southeast of San Gorgonio Pass is dipping to the northeast. Investigation of the nonuniqueness of the 1-D Vs inversion suggests that imaging the top 3-km Vs structure requires either shorter period ({$\leq$}2 s) surface wave dispersion measurements or other types of data set such as Rayleigh wave ellipticity.},

Although the literature is very mature, not many strategies are available when these design problems appear in the context of sparse linear models commonly encountered in high dimensional machine learning. In this work, we study this budget constrained design where the underlying regression model involves a {$\mathscr{l}$}1-regularized linear function. We propose two novel strategies: the first is motivated geometrically whereas the second is algebraic in nature. We obtain tractable algorithms for this problem which also hold for a more general class of sparse linear models. We perform a detailed set of experiments, on benchmarks and a large neuroimaging study, showing that the proposed models are effective in practice. The latter experiment suggests that these ideas may play a small role in informing enrollment strategies for similar scientific studies in the future.},

  abstract = {Adaptive stacking provides a powerful and rapid procedure for estimating the residual patterns across a network of seismic stations. The approach exploits predictions from some propagation model to achieve an approximate alignment of traces, which are then stacked to form a reference trace. Iterative improvement of the alignment, by comparison of the reference trace with each station trace, leads to a direct estimate of the residuals from the propagation model. Our implementation is fast and robust in the presence of significant noise and waveforms of different character. The major difference from earlier forms is the use of a direct minimization scheme for determining the best match between the reference stacked trace and each recorded trace based on an L-3 measure of misfit. This approach has the benefit of generating automatic error estimates. For teleseismic applications, the ak135 model has proved to be very effective for selection of the window around the desired phase and in achieving initial alignment. The approach can be applied to both first motion (P) and later phases (e.g. PCP), with extraction of absolute time via (t)he improved signal-to-noise properties of the stacked trace, after full alignment. The new method is illustrated with three teleseismic events from a similar source region that were recorded by the 72 station TIGGER array in northern Tasmania. Despite significant levels of noise and contrasting waveforms produced by the three events, the residual patterns are very similar. Even when large time-shifts are introduced into the records, trace alignment is achieved with rapid convergence of the iterative procedure and excellent recovery of the imposed shifts. These results confirm adaptive stacking as a valuable alternative to data based cross-correlation techniques, particularly when heterogeneous instrumentation is employed.},

Due to length limitations, we cannot hope to cover every aspect of this diverse topic or include mathematical derivations of the underlying principles; rather, we will provide a largely descriptive coverage of the methodology that is targeted at readers not intimately familiar with the topic. The relative merits of local versus global parameterization, ray tracing versus wavefront tracking, backprojection versus gradient based inversion and synthetic testing versus model covariance are explored. A variety of key application areas are also discussed, including body wave traveltime tomography, surface wave tomography, attenuation tomography and ambient noise tomography. Established and emerging trends, many of which are driven by the ongoing rapid increases in available computing power, will also be examined, including finite frequency tomography, full waveform tomography and joint tomography using multiple datasets. Several practical applications of seismic tomography, including body wave traveltime, attenuation and surface waveform, are presented in order to reinforce prior discussion of theory.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis with synthetic models is widely used in seismic tomography as a means for assessing the spatial resolution of solutions produced by, in most cases, linear or iterative nonlinear inversion schemes. The most common type of synthetic reconstruction test is the so-called checkerboard resolution test in which the synthetic model comprises an alternating pattern of higher and lower wave speed (or some other seismic property such as attenuation) in 2-D or 3-D. Although originally introduced for application to large inverse problems for which formal resolution and covariance could not be computed, these tests have achieved popularity, even when resolution and covariance can be computed, by virtue of being simple to implement and providing rapid and intuitive insight into the reliability of the recovered model. However, checkerboard tests have a number of potential drawbacks, including (1) only providing indirect evidence of quantitative measures of reliability such as resolution and uncertainty, (2) giving a potentially misleading impression of the range of scale-lengths that can be resolved, and (3) not giving a true picture of the structural distortion or smearing that can be caused by the data coverage. The widespread use of synthetic reconstruction tests in seismic tomography is likely to continue for some time yet, so it is important to implement best practice where possible. The goal of this paper is to develop the underlying theory and carry out a series of numerical experiments in order to establish best practice and identify some common pitfalls. Based on our findings, we recommend (1) the use of a discrete spike test involving a sparse distribution of spikes, rather than the use of the conventional tightly spaced checkerboard; (2) using data coverage (e.g. ray-path geometry) inherited from the model constrained by the observations (i.e. the same forward operator or matrix), rather than the data coverage obtained by solving the forward problem through the synthetic model; (3) carrying out multiple tests using structures of different scale length; (4) taking special care with regard to what can be inferred when using synthetic structures that closely mimic what has been recovered in the observation-based model; (5) investigating the range of structural wavelengths that can be recovered using realistic levels of imposed data noise; and (6) where feasible, assessing the influence of model parametrization error, which arises from making a choice as to how structure is to be represented.},

  abstract = {The fast marching method (FMM) is a grid based numerical scheme for tracking the evolution of monotonically advancing interfaces via finite-difference solution of the eikonal equation. Like many other grid based techniques, FMM is only capable of finding the first-arriving phase in continuous media; however, it distinguishes itself by combining both unconditional stability and rapid computation, making it a truly practical scheme for velocity fields of arbitrary complexity. The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of FMM for finding later arriving phases in layered media. In particular, we focus on reflections from smooth subhorizontal interfaces that separate regions of continuous velocity variation. The method we adopt for calculating reflected phases involves two stages: the first stage initializes FMM at the source and tracks the incident wave front to all points on the reflector surface; the second stage tracks the reflected wave front by reinitializing FMM from the interface point with minimum traveltime. Layer velocities are described by a regular grid of velocity nodes and layer boundaries are described by a set of interface nodes that may be irregularly distributed. A triangulation routine is used to locally suture interface nodes to neighbouring velocity nodes in order to facilitate the tracking of wave fronts to and from the reflector. A number of synthetic tests are carried out to assess the accuracy, speed and robustness of the new scheme. These include comparisons with analytic solutions and with solutions obtained from a shooting method of ray tracing. The convergence of traveltimes as grid spacing is reduced is also examined. Results from these tests indicate that wave fronts can be accurately tracked with minimal computational effort, even in the presence of complex velocity fields and layer boundaries with high curvature. Incident wave fronts containing gradient discontinuities or shocks also pose no difficulty. Further development of the wave front reinitialization scheme should allow other later arrivals such as multiples to be successfully located.},

  abstract = {The secular rate of Australia's vertical surface deformation due to past ice-ocean loading changes is not consistent with present vertical velocities observed by a previously sparse network of Global Positioning System (GPS) sites. Current understanding of the Earth's rheology suggests that the expected vertical motion of the crust should be close to zero given that Australia is located in the far field of past ice sheet loading. Recent GPS measurements suggest that the vertical motion of the Australian continent at permanent sites is between 0 and -2 mm/year. Here we investigate if vertical deformation due to previous ice sheet loading can be recovered in the time series of Australian GPS sites through enlarging the number of sites compared to previous studies from \textasciitilde 20 to more than 100 and through the application of improved data filtering. We apply forward geophysical models of elastic surface displacement induced by atmospheric, hydrologic, nontidal ocean, and ice loading and use independent component analysis as a spatiotemporal filter that includes multivariate regression to consider temporally correlated noise in GPS. Using this approach, the common mode error is identified, and subsequent multivariate regression leads to an average reduction in trend uncertainty of \textasciitilde 35\%. The average vertical subsidence of the Australian continent is substantially different to vertical motion predicted by glacial isostatic adjustment and surface mass transport models.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for automatically detecting transient deformation signals from geodetic time series. We cast the detection problem as a least squares procedure where the design matrix corresponds to a highly overcomplete, nonorthogonal dictionary of displacement functions in time that resemble transient signals of various timescales. The addition of a sparsity-inducing regularization term to the cost function limits the total number of dictionary elements needed to reconstruct the signal. Sparsity-inducing regularization enhances interpretability of the resultant time-dependent model by localizing the dominant timescales and onset times of the transient signals. Transient detection can then be performed using convex optimization software where detection sensitivity is dependent on the strength of the applied sparsity-inducing regularization. To assess uncertainties associated with estimation of the dictionary coefficients, we compare solutions with those found through a Bayesian inference approach to sample the full model space for each dictionary element. In addition to providing uncertainty bounds on the coefficients and confirming the optimization results, Bayesian sampling reveals trade-offs between dictionary elements that have nearly equal probability in modeling a transient signal. Thus, we can rigorously assess the probabilities of the occurrence of transient signals and their characteristic temporal evolution. The detection algorithm is applied on several synthetic time series and real observed GPS time series for the Cascadia region. For the latter data set, we incorporate a spatial weighting scheme that self-adjusts to the local network density and filters for spatially coherent signals. The weighting allows for the automatic detection of repeating slow slip events.},

These three parameters allow us to completely characterize the response of the instruments. We find that the responses of all components match a mean-derived response to within 5\% of amplitude and 0.03 radians in phase. This close agreement suggests that for most applications a nominal response is suitable. We also checked the timing of the units as compared to a Quanterra Q330HR and found good agreement up to 200 samples=s. Finally, we compared the results of our noise tests on these sensors to a couple of nodal sensors recently deployed at the Community Wavefield Demonstration Experiment in north-central Oklahoma and found that local site noise and not the sensor self-noise is a fundamental limiter in the resolution of these deployed sensors at frequencies above {$\sim$}0:1 Hz.},

However, a number of studies have observed that significant scatter appears in these measurements making it difficult to use H/V ratio measurements to resolve earth structure. Some of the scatter in these measurements has been attributed to local geological structure while some has remained unaccounted for. Most Global Seismographic Network (GSN) stations contain two nearby high-quality broad-band seismometers (e.g. in the same vault, but on different piers or in different boreholes). For each broad-band sensor in the IRIS/USGS component of the GSN, we estimate H/V ratios of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves using M {$>$} 6.5 earthquakes from 2001 to 2018 (around 19 000 measurements). We compute these ratios at a number of discrete periods (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 s) and find that for well-isolated Rayleigh waves (windows where the correlation coefficients between radial and the phase-shifted vertical components are greater than 0.9) significant scatter in H/V ratios occurs between colocated sensors (greater than 25 per cent at 100 s period). This suggests the scatter in H/V ratio measurements can be at least partially attributed to extremely local phenomena such as sensor emplacement in the vault. We also find that H/V ratios can vary as a function of event backazimuth, indicating that care must be taken when computing average ratios for a station, as a large number of events from a given region could bias H/V ratio measurements at a station.},

In this paper we present a fracture criterion, incorporating new experimental fracture data, coupled with an ice shelf flow model to predict the spatial distribution of surface crevassing on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. We have developed experiments that have enabled us to quantify, for the first time, quasi-stable crack growth in Antarctic ice core specimens using a fracture initiation toughness, K-init, for which crack growth commences. The tests cover a full range of nearsurface densities, rho = 560-871 kg m(-3) (10.9-75.7 m depth). Results indicate an apparently linear dependence of fracture toughness on porosity such that K-int = 0.257 rho-80.7, predicting a zero-porosity toughness of K-o = 155 kPa m(1/2). We have used this data to test the applicability to crevassing of a two-dimensional fracture mechanics criterion for the propagation of a small sharp crack in a biaxial stress field. The growth of an initial flaw into a larger crevasse, which involves a purely tensile crack opening, depends on the size of the flaw, the magnitude of K-init, and the nature of the applied stress field. By incorporating the criterion into a stress map of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf derived from a depth-integrated finite element model of the strain-rate field, we have been able to predict regions of potential crevassing. These agree well with satellite imagery provided an initial flaw size is assumed in the range 5-50 cm.},

Spectral-element synthetics show that this variation can be attributed mostly to the effect of crustal thickness on the long-period PP reflection coefficient. The anomalies of SS/S are similar in amplitude but their geographic variation does not obviously correlate with ocean/continent variations. The variation of SS/S determined from spectral-element waveforms of S and SS for 3-D models of the crust and mantle is similar to the observed variation of SS/S. This suggests that wave propagation effects are largely responsible for the observed SS/S variation, not only intrinsic attenuation.},

This data set is an order of magnitude larger than used for S20RTS and includes new data types. The data are related to shear-velocity perturbations from the (anisotropic) PREM model via kernel functions and ray paths that are computed using PREM. Contributions to phase delays and traveltimes from the heterogeneous crust are estimated using model CRUST2.0. We calculate crustal traveltimes from long-period synthetic waveforms rather than using ray theory. Shear-velocity perturbations are parametrized by spherical harmonics up to degree 40 and by 21 vertical spline functions for a total of 35 301 degrees of freedom. S40RTS is characterised by 8000 resolved unknowns. Since we compute the exact inverse, it is straightforward to determine models associated with fewer or more unknowns by adjusting the model damping. S40RTS shares many characteristics with S20RTS because it is based on the same data types and similar modelling procedures. However, S40RTS shows more clearly than S20RTS the abrupt change in the pattern of shear-velocity heterogeneity across the 660-km phase transition and it presents a more complex patern of shear-velocity heterogeneity in the lower mantle.

These nonlinearities in the tidal modulation of buttressing stresses can be caused by asymmetries in the contact stress from migration of the grounding line and bathymetric pinning points beneath the ice shelf. Using a simple viscoelastic model, we demonstrate that a combination of buttressing and hydrostatic stress variations can explain a diverse range of tidal variations in ice shelf flow, including the period, phase and amplitude of flow variations observed at Rutford and Bindschadler Ice Streams.},

  abstract = {Paleoseismic data from 11 trenches at seven sites excavated across the southern Johnson Valley, Kickapoo, and Homestead Valley faults that ruptured in the 1992 Landers earthquake, as well as the northern Johnson Valley fault which did not fail in 1992, indicate that the return period for large surface rupturing events in this part of the eastern California shear zone is in the range of 5-15 ka. The inferred slip rates, based on their respective recurrence intervals, are in the range of 0.2-0.6 mm/yr for each of the faults studied. A previous large earthquake ruptured the southern Johnson Valley and Kickapoo faults about 5 ka B.P. The northern Johnson Valley fault: also failed at about this time at 5.8 ka B.P. and may have been part of the same rupture. In contrast, the penultimate large earthquake that we identify on the Homestead Valley fault occurred about 15 ka B.P., much earlier than other faults involved in the 1992 rupture. From these observations, combined with paleoseismic work by others after the 1992 earthquake, it appears that previous events along the southern Johnson Valley and Kickapoo faults were different than those of 1992 and may have involved other fault segments. It has been over 5 ka since the most recent rupture on the northern Johnson Valley fault. Therefore, it is surprising that it did not fail in the 1992 rupture. From our observations, dextral shear appears to be distributed across the entire eastern California shear zone. with individual faults taking only a small proportion of the overall slip. Release of this regional strain appears to occur in temporal clusters of large (?) earthquakes, with the 1992 event apparently the most recent of a sequence of late Holocene (0-1 ka) earthquakes that have ruptured the nine faults we have trenched in the southwestern Mojave desert. Previous dusters of earthquake activity occurred in the early (8-9 ka) and middle (5-6 ka) Holocene, and possibly the latest Pleistocene (similar to 15 ka).},

  abstract = {We invert ISC PcP and PKP absolute and differential traveltimes in an attempt to infer the long-wavelength topography of the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The data selection and processing methods are described and evaluated. These traveltime data are very noisy and the geographic distribution of the data is highly non-uniform, inhibiting reliable inference of CMB topography. Spatial averaging enhances the coherent component of the residual variance (related to heterogeneity), however, the random component of the variance is much larger than the coherent component. We show that for PcP data the coherent signal due to mantle heterogeneity overshadows that arising from the CMB, and that the effects of mantle heterogeneity are mapped into our inferred CMB solutions. The PcP data are not correlated across the spatial averaging bins and seem to have a strong bias due to small-scale structure and/or noise. The non-uniform geographic sampling of the data plays a role in the mapping of mantle heterogeneity onto the CMB. Spatial patterns of CMB models inferred from different phases do not agree. Amplitudes of seismically inferred CMB undulations vary greatly. The sensitivity of inferred CMB models to the processing, spatial averaging procedure, and inversion techniques are investigated. Topographic amplitudes increase strongly with increasing input residual variance. The power spectrum of inferred topography indicates that there are unmodelled heterogeneities that must be described with spherical harmonics of degree 6 and higher. Based on this work, we conclude that reliable inference of long-wavelength CMB topography is not likely with the current ISC data set or with a spherical harmonic expansion truncated to degree and order 6.},

We leverage advances in earthquake monitoring with a deep-learning algorithm to image a fault zone hosting a 4-year-long swarm in southern California. We infer that fluids are naturally injected into the fault zone from below and diffuse through strike-parallel channels while triggering earthquakes. A permeability barrier initially limits up-dip swarm migration but ultimately is circumvented. This enables fluid migration within a shallower section of the fault with fundamentally different mechanical properties. Our observations provide high-resolution constraints on the processes by which swarms initiate, grow, and arrest. These findings illustrate how swarm evolution is strongly controlled by 3D variations in fault architecture.},

  abstract = {The Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model is one of the best-performing methods for seismic forecasting. However most studies of ETAS use point estimates for the model parameters, which ignores the inherent uncertainty that arises from estimating these from historical earthquake catalogs, resulting in misleadingly optimistic forecasts. In contrast, Bayesian statistics allows parameter uncertainty to be explicitly represented, and fed into the forecast distribution. Despite its growing popularity in seismology, the application of Bayesian statistics to the ETAS model has been limited by the complex nature of the resulting posterior distribution which makes it infeasible to apply on catalogs containing more than a few hundred earthquakes. To combat this, we develop a new framework for estimating the ETAS model in a fully Bayesian manner, which can be efficiently scaled up to large catalogs containing thousands of earthquakes. We also provide easy-to-use software which implements our method.},

We present a 2D lossy seismic data compression algorithm, based on sub-band coding, and we focus on adaptation and optimization of the method for common-offset gathers. The sub-band coding algorithm consists of five stages: first, a preprocessing phase using an automatic gain control to decrease the non-stationary behaviour of seismic data; second, a decorrelation stage using a uniform analysis filter bank to concentrate the energy of seismic data into a minimum number of sub-bands; third, an iterative classification algorithm, based on an estimation of variances of blocks of sub-band samples, to classify the sub-band samples into a fixed number of classes with approximately the same statistics; fourth, a quantization step using a uniform scalar quantizer, which gives an approximation of the sub-band samples to allow for high compression ratios; and fifth, an entropy coding stage using a fixed number of arithmetic encoders matched to the corresponding statistics of the classified and quantized sub-band samples to achieve compression. Decompression basically performs the opposite operations in reverse order. We compare the proposed algorithm with three other seismic data compression algorithms. The high performance of our optimized sub-band coding method is supported by objective and subjective results.},

Assessing this relationship is valuable both for the insights it provides about volcanism, and for the practical challenge of risk management. We derive a global magnitude\textendash frequency relationship for explosive volcanic eruptions of at least 300 Mt of erupted mass (or M4.5). Our approach is essentially empirical, based on the eruptions recorded in the LaMEVE database. It differs from previous approaches mainly in our conservative treatment of magnituderounding and under-recording. Our estimate for the return period of `super-eruptions' (1000 Gt, or M8) is 17 ka (95\% CI: 5.2 ka, 48 ka), which is substantially shorter than previous estimates, indicating that volcanoes pose a larger risk to human civilisation than previously thought.},

The width to height ratio of the injection veins is a direct measure of the shear strain in the wall rock required to accommodate the injection, so the aspect ratios preserve a record of the overpressure opening the cracks and injecting melt or fluidized granular material from the fault zone. We measured the aspect ratios for 201 pseudotachylyte injections and 29 granular injections. They have aspect ratios of similar to 0.2 (0.17 +/- 0.025 and 0.22 +/- 0.077, respectively, within 99\% confidence). These are significantly proportionally wider than the aspect ratios of ordinary dikes (from 10(-4) to 10(-3)). The injection aspect ratios exceed the usual limit of elastic strain in the wallrock (similar to 1\%) so we infer that the injection veins were accommodated by permanent deformation by microcracking and slip on foliation surfaces in the host rock, which is difficult to detect observationally. The fully elastic model therefore offers an upper bound on the stress required to open these injection veins (similar to 10(8)-10(10) Pa, with higher pressures in stiffer host rock lithologies.) These overpressures cannot be achieved by expansion of the fault rock fluids during melting or gouge fluidization mechanisms, as the pressure along the fault is limited to 107 Pa by the wall rock compliance. Dynamic tension parallel to the fault is required to explain the large apparent overpressures in the injection veins. Therefore, both pseudotachylyte and gouge injections of this aspect ratio must be considered seismic signatures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo methods are powerful approaches to solve nonlinear problems and are becoming very popular in Earth sciences. One reason being that, at first glance, no constraints or explicit regularization of model parameters are required. At second glance, one might realize that regularization is done through a prior. The choice of this prior, however, is subjective, and with its choice, unintended or undesired extra information can be injected into the problem. The principal criticism of Bayesian methods is that the prior can be ``tuned'' in order to get the expected solution. Consequently, detractors of the Bayesian method could easily argue that the solution is influenced by the form of the prior distribution, which choice is subjective. Hence, models obtained with Monte Carlo methods are still highly debated. Here we investigate the influence of a priori constraints (i.e., fixed crustal discontinuities) on the posterior probability distributions of estimated parameters, that is, vertical polarized shear velocity VSV and radial anisotropy \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend, in a transdimensional Bayesian inversion for continental lithospheric structure. We follow upon the work of Cal\`o et al. (2016), who jointly inverted converted phases (P to S) without deconvolution and surface wave dispersion data, to obtain 1-D radial anisotropic shear wave velocity profiles in the North American craton. We aim at verifying whether the strong lithospheric layering found in the stable part of the craton is robust with respect to artifacts that might be caused by the methodology used. We test the hypothesis that the observed midlithospheric discontinuities result from (1) fixed crustal discontinuities in the reference model and (2) a fixed Vp/Vs ratio. The synthetic tests on two Earth models show that a fixed Vp/Vs ratio does not introduce artificial layering, even if the assumed value is slightly wrong. This is an important finding for real data inversion where the true value is not always available or accurate. However, fixing crustal discontinuities can lead to the introduction of spurious layering, and this is not recommended. Additionally, allowing the Vp/Vs ratio to vary does not help preventing that. Applying the modified approach resulting from these tests to two stations (FRB and FCC) in the North American craton, we confirm the presence of at least one midlithospheric low-velocity layer. We also confirm the difficulty of consistently detecting the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in the craton.},

The term seismic interferometry refers to the principle of generating new seismic responses by cross-correlating seismic observations at different receiver locations. The application of interferometric techniques on a global scale could create sources at locations where no earthquakes occur. In this way, yet unknown responses would become available for the application of travel-time tomography and surface-wave dispersion studies.

  abstract = {With seismic interferometry, reflections can be retrieved between stations positioned on the Earth's surface. In the classical form, the reflections are retrieved by a crosscorrelation of observations and an integration over subsurface sources. For a specific data set, however, the actual source distribution might not be sufficient to approximate the source integral. Yet, there might be a dense distribution of receivers allowing an integration over the receiver domain. We rewrite the source integral to an integration over receiver pairs and call it receiver-pair seismic interferometry (RPSI). With this formulation, reflections can be retrieved even in the limiting case of only a single source. We illustrate the new relation both with synthetic data and data from the USArray, which is a large grid of stations covering the USA. The field observations are from an earthquake in Mexico. We show that RPSI can be applied both for a line and grid of receivers. When using isolated phases recorded over a line of stations inline with the earthquake, reflections are retrieved from the core-mantle boundary, which reflections can be ascribed to specific virtual source and receiver locations within the USArray. When using full responses as input to RPSI, the retrieved phases are an average over multiple virtual sources and receivers. Location is then only possible when the integrand is spatially windowed or when a clear leading term is identified. When using a grid of receivers, the location of the source does not need to be known, but spatially averaged instead of localized responses are obtained, also when isolated arrivals are used as input to RPSI.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenging problem of optimal experimental design (OED) of constrained inverse problems. We consider two OED formulations that allow to reduce the experimental costs by minimizing the number of measurements. The first formulation assumes a fine discretization of the design parameter space and uses sparsity promoting regularization to obtain an efficient design. The second formulation parameterizes the design and seeks optimal placement for these measurements by solving a small-dimensional optimization problem. We consider both problems in a Bayes risk as well as an empirical Bayes risk minimization framework. For the unconstrained inverse state problem, we exploit the closed form solution for the inner problem to efficiently compute derivatives for the outer OED problem. The empirical formulation does not require an explicit solution of the inverse problem and therefore allows to integrate constraints efficiently. A key contribution is an efficient optimization method for solving the resulting, typically high-dimensional, bilevel optimization problem using derivative-based methods. To overcome the lack of non-differentiability in active set methods for inequality constraints problems, we use a relaxed interior point method. To address the growing computational complexity of empirical Bayes OED, we parallelize the computation over the training models. Numerical examples and illustrations from tomographic reconstruction, for various data sets and under different constraints, demonstrate the impact of constraints on the optimal design and highlight the importance of OED for constrained problems.},

The difference in density between hcp-Fe and the inner core in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) shows a density deficit, which implies an existence of light elements in the core. Sound velocities then provide an important constraint on the amount and kind of light elements in the core. Although seismological observations provide density-sound velocity data of Earth's core, there are few measurements in controlled laboratory conditions for comparison. We report the compressional sound velocity (V P) of hcp-Fe up to 163 GPa and 3000 K using inelastic x-ray scattering from a laser-heated sample in a diamond anvil cell. We propose a new high-temperature Birch's law for hcp-Fe, which gives us the V P of pure hcp-Fe up to core conditions. We find that Earth's inner core has a 4 to 5\% smaller density and a 4 to 10\% smaller V P than hcp-Fe. Our results demonstrate that components other than Fe in Earth's core are required to explain Earth's core density and velocity deficits compared to hcp-Fe. Assuming that the temperature effects on iron alloys are the same as those on hcp-Fe, we narrow down light elements in the inner core in terms of the velocity deficit. Hydrogen is a good candidate; thus, Earth's core may be a hidden hydrogen reservoir. Silicon and sulfur are also possible candidates and could show good agreement with PREM if we consider the presence of some melt in the inner core, anelasticity, and/or a premelting effect.},

Existing approaches to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force independence between the layers, and do not work well in practice. We present a doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm that does not force independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a billion points.

It is often used to determine time series similarity, classification, and to find corresponding regions between two time series.

In this paper we introduce FastDTW, an approximation of DTW that has a linear time and space complexity. FastDTW uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarse resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically.

Ambient noise cross correlation, which is well-suited to studying shallow earth structure, is commonly used to analyze fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves and, increasingly, Love waves. Here we show via multicomponent ambient noise cross correlation that the basement resonance frequency in the Canterbury region of New Zealand can be straightforwardly determined based on the horizontal to vertical amplitude ratio (H/V ratio) of the first higher-mode Rayleigh waves. At periods of 1-3 s, the first higher-mode is evident on the radial-radial cross-correlation functions but almost absent in the vertical-vertical cross-correlation functions, implying longitudinal motion and a high H/V ratio. A one-dimensional regional velocity model incorporating a similar to 1.5 km-thick sedimentary layer fits both the observed H/V ratio and Rayleigh wave group velocity. Similar analysis may enable resonance characteristics of other sedimentary basins to be determined.},

  abstract = {Standard processing of seismic events for reporting in bulletins is usually done one-at-a time. State-of-the-art relative event methods, often involving cross correlation, are increasingly used and have improved estimates of event parameters for event detection, location and magnitude. This is because relative event techniques can simultaneously reduce measurement error and effects of model error. We show how cross correlation can be used to assign relative magnitudes for neighbouring seismic events distributed over a large region in east Asia and quantify to what extent the uncertainty in these values increases as waveform similarity breaks down. We find that cross correlation works well for magnitude comparison of two events when it is expected that they generate very similar signals even if these may be almost buried in large amounts of noise. This may be the case when investigating repeating earthquakes or nuclear explosions within a few kilometres of each other. Cross correlation is the optimal detector in these cases assuming noise is white and Gaussian, and also provides the least-squares solution for the relative amplitudes. However, when the waveform similarity of the underlying signals breaks down, due to interevent separation distance, source time function differences or focal mechanism differences, these assumptions are no longer valid and a bias is introduced into the relative magnitude measurement. This bias due to degradation of waveform similarity is modelled here with synthetics and an analytic expression for it is derived based on three terms-the cross-correlation coefficient (CC), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the larger and smaller events. The analytic expression is a good match to the observed bias in the data. If the equation for relative magnitude is rewritten to correct for the bias due to the CC, a new equation results which is simply the log of the ratio of the L2 norms. The bias due to SNRs is still present because the observed waveforms inevitably contain both signal and noise. However, this bias is predicted to be minimal for typical detection thresholds. Making measurements of the ratio of the L2 norms is shown to remove the bias due to degradation of waveform similarity for real data. The scatter of these cross-correlation measurements of relative magnitude is much less than those obtained by differencing magnitudes in a traditional catalogue. Of 14 025 events in and near China, 34 per cent had over an order of magnitude reduction in the median standard deviation (0.0342 magnitude units) as compared to the estimated scatter in the catalogue (0.3454 magnitude units). And 78 per cent of the events show a factor 3 improvement or better in the precision of relative event size measured as the ratio of the L2 norms as compared to the precision of the catalogue for relative magnitudes. These results suggest that the ratio of the L2 norms is an appropriate measure of relative magnitudes for general seismicity of a monitoring region, when there is significant waveform dissimilarity for neighbouring events. This measure maintains a higher degree of measurement precision as compared to the catalogue.},

Although high-frequency noise autocorrelations are now used to extract the reflectivity beneath seismic stations, low-frequency autocorrelations are hardly applied. Here, we present the observation of the Earth orbiting surface waves from low-frequency noise autocorrelations which are used to extract normal-mode frequencies for the Hum. The performances of the classical and phase autocorrelations are analyzed using seismic data from GEOSCOPE station TAM in Algeria. Both approaches are independent and perform differently for data with large amplitude variability. We show that the phase autocorrelation can robustly extract Rayleigh waves and normal modes because it is not biased by large amplitude signals (e.g., earthquakes). This is convenient because no data preprocessing (data selection or amplitude clipping) is required as usually employed for the classical approaches. This implies that the phase correlation takes advantage of the full data set and waveform information to achieve a high signal extraction convergence. Single-station phase autocorrelations may become an important tool in planetary seismology where data are limited due to the expensive and difficult data acquisition and can consist of high-amplitude variability due to unknown conditions. The upcoming INSIGHT (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) Mars mission plans the deployment of one broadband seismometer and the successful measurement of normal-mode frequencies and surface-wave dispersion curves will constrain its reference structure. Although we present low-frequency autocorrelations, our findings remain valid for cross correlations, other applications, and other frequency bands.},

The method presented can easily be extended to phase-weighted cross-correlations or be applied in the tau-p domain. We illustrate and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of PWS in comparison with other coherency measures and present examples. We further show that our non-linear stacking technique enables us to detect a weak lower-mantle P-to-S conversion from a depth of approximately 840 km on array data.

For epicentral distances of approximately 150{$\smwhtcircle$}, PKP and P4KP follow the same path through the crust and mantle and differ only in the core, since P4KP reflects three times at the underside of the CMB. Hence traveltime differences should only be due to the path differences in the core. We use array techniques in order to enhance the signal to noise ratio and confirm the slowness and backazimuth of the P4KP waves. Data from the Gra\textasciidieresis fenberg Array in southern Germany yield a total of 27 events with observable P4KP waves. We find most traveltime residuals between theoretical and observed P4KP minus PKP arrival time generally within a range of {$\pm$}7 s. A ray tracing method is used to model the deviations of traveltimes due to changes of CMB depth at the reflection points of the P4KP waves. It is not possible to explain the observed traveltime residuals with changes in depth of the CMB only; in several cases, the residuals are too large to be caused by CMB topography alone. Due to the expected coinciding ray paths of PKP and P4KP, the remaining variations are unlikely to be produced by heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle, and so remain for the moment unaccounted for. We find that the reflection coefficient of P4KP undergoes a polarity reversal for some scenarios of lower mantle velocities and densities and the observed P4KP polarity at this distance range can therefore help to investigate the lowermost mantle in addition to CMB topography.},

  abstract = {Measurements and mechanical models of heterogeneous bedload transport in rivers remain basic challenges for studies of landscape evolution and watershed management. A 700 m reach of the Trinity River (northern California, USA), a large gravel-bed river, was instrumented with an array of 76 seismographs during a dam-controlled flood and gravel augmentation to investigate the potential for out-ofstream monitoring. The temporal response to gravel augmentation during constant discharge provides strong evidence of seismic sensitivity to bedload transport and aids in identification of the seismic frequencies most sensitive to bedload in the study area. Following gravel augmentations, the seismic array reveals a period of enhanced transport that spans most or all of the reach for \textasciitilde 7\textendash 10 h. Neither the duration nor the downstream extent of enhanced transport would have been constrained without the seismic array. Sensitivity to along-stream transport variations is further demonstrated by seismic amplitudes that decrease between the upper and lower halves of the reach consistent with decreased bedload flux constrained by time-lapse bathymetry. Insight into the magnitude of impact energy that reaches the bed is also gained from the seismic array. Observed peak seismic power is \textasciitilde 1\%\textendash 5\% of that predicted by a model of saltation over exposed bedrock. Our results suggest that dissipation of impact energy due to cover effects needs to be considered to seismically constrain bedload transport rates, and that noninvasive constraints from seismology can be used to test and refine mechanical models of bedload transport.},

But rapid progress is now within reach. New computational tools and methods from data assimilation and machine learning make it possible to integrate global observations and local high-resolution simulations in an Earth system model (ESM) that systematically learns from both and quantifies uncertainties. Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to realize it.},

  abstract = {Current interpretations of seismic observations typically argue for significant chemical heterogeneity being present in the two large low shear velocity provinces under Africa and the Pacific. Recently, however, it has been suggested that large lateral temperature variations in the lowermost mantle resulting from a strong thermal gradient across D? may provide an alternative explanation. In case of a high heat flux from the core into the mantle, the magnitude of shear wave velocity variations in tomographic models can be reconciled with isochemical whole mantle flow and a pyrolite composition. So far, the hypothesis of strong core heating has been tested in a consistent manner only against tomographic S-wave velocity models, but not against P-wave velocity models. Here, we explore a new approach to assess geodynamic models and test the assumption of isochemical whole mantle flow with strong core heating directly against the statistics of observed traveltime variations of both P and S waves. Using a spectral element method, we simulate 3-D global wave propagation for periods down to 10 s in synthetic 3-D elastic structures derived from a geodynamic model. Seismic heterogeneity is predicted by converting the temperature field of a high-resolution mantle circulation model (MCM) into seismic velocities using thermodynamic models of mantle mineralogy. Being based on forward modelling only, this approach avoids the problems of limited resolution and non-uniqueness inherent in tomographic inversions while taking all possible finite-frequency effects into account. Capturing the correct physics of wave propagation allows for a consistent test of the assumption of high core heat flow against seismic data.},

Interferometric seismic imaging can also migrate free-surface multiples in common depth point (CDP) data and image source distributions from passive seismic data. Both synthetic and field data examples are used to illustrate the different possibilities of II. The key advantage of II is that it can image source locations or reflectivity distributions from passive seismic data where the source position or wavelet is unknown. In some cases it can mitigate defocusing errors as a result of statics or an incorrect migration velocity. The main drawback with II is that severe migration artefacts can be created by partial focusing of virtual multiples.},

  abstract = {Seismic S-wave receiver functions (SRF) are a uniquely powerful tool for imaging velocity discontinuities within the upper mantle. SRF data frequently contain negative phases at depths between similar to 80 and 100 km within the continental lithosphere, indicative of large and sharp velocity drops at these depths. In young, actively tectonic areas with thin lithosphere, this feature is generally interpreted as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. However, in tectonically stable areas it occurs within the continental lithospheric mantle and has been termed the mid-lithosphere discontinuity (MLD). A significant velocity drop at such depths is unexpected and its cause is unknown. In this manuscript, we summarise the current observations and assess the main mechanisms that could produce such a feature. We find that changes in mantle iron content (Mg\#) and elastically-accommodated grainboundary sliding are unlikely to result in sufficiently large velocity decreases to produce an observable SRF response, while partial melt will generally only exist at greater depths within stable lithosphere. Radial and azimuthal seismic anisotropy are both capable of producing negative SRF phases. However, azimuthal anisotropy will not produce consistently negative phases independent of back-azimuth. Some geometries of radial anisotropy can produce consistent negative phases but such geometries are not observed universally and are hard to explain tectonically. Low-velocity minerals can cause sharp and large decreases in seismic velocity. Amphibole-rich layers are likely to form at MLD depths in metasomatised regions, making amphibole a possible cause for the MLD. However, some xenolith sections contain no amphibole, suggesting this may not be a universal explanation. A careful assessment of SRFs shows that the continental lithospheric mantle generally contains numerous positive and negative velocity discontinuities and is spatially heterogeneous. Long-period band-pass filtering can combine smaller features and may lead to the appearance of a larger and more coherent velocity decrease at the MLD than actually exists. We propose that many of the assessed mechanisms may be acting at different depths in different locations to produce numerous velocity discontinuities. The large MLD phase is likely to be commonly associated with amphibole but on current evidence there is no universal cause for the MLD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We carry out a beamforming analysis of body waves at periods of 10 and 40 s recorded at USArray and show that the late coda, up to 10 h after the Okhotsk earthquake, is dominated by waves propagating in the great circle direction; late coda waves are not equipartitioned. This implies for seismic interferometry that teleseismic body waves can only be extracted from the coda when the earthquake and the receivers are located on a great circle. This happens automatically when the employed stations are antipodal or when the autocorrelation of waves is used. The use of long-period ambient seismic noise relies on the distribution of sources because scattering only marginally randomizes directions. This provides insight into recent observations of core phases extracted from seismic interferometry.},

In other words, in addition to the layer properties, the number of layers is also treated as a variable in our formulation.

  abstract = {Recent high pressure experimental results reveal that the elastic and transport properties of mantle materials are impacted by the electronic spin transition in iron under lower mantle pressure and temperature conditions. The electronic transition in ferropericlase (Fp), the second major constituent mineral of the lower mantle material, is associated with a smooth increase in density starting from the mid-mantle depth to the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The transition also yields softening in the elastic moduli and an increase in the thermal expansivity over the transition zone in the lower mantle. Although there is not yet robust experimental evidence for spin-transition induced density change in the perovskite (Pv) phase (the major constituent mineral in the lower mantle), the spin transition in the octahedral (B) site in Al-free perovskite causes a bulk modulus hardening (increase in the bulk modulus) in the mineral. We have incorporated these physical processes into high resolution 3D-spherical control volume models for mantle convection. A series of numerical experiments explore how the electronic spin transition in iron modifies the mantle flow, and in particular the fate of sinking cold slabs. Such mid mantle stagnations are prevalent globally in seismic tomographic inversions, but previous explanations for their existence are not satisfactory. Employing density anomalies from the iron spin transition in ferropericlase and density anomaly models for perovskite, we study the influence of the spin transition in the minerals of the lower mantle on mantle flow. Our model results reveal that while the spin transition induced property variations in ferropericlase enhance mixing in the lower depths of the mantle, the density anomaly arising from the hardening in the bulk modulus of Al-free perovskite can be effective in slowing the descent of slabs and may cause stagnation at mid-mantle levels. A viscosity hill in the lower mantle may further enhance the stagnation effect. Cold descending slabs can stall in the mid mantle for tens of million years or even longer before penetrating to the lower mantle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We investigate the influence of this phase transformation on the geoid using 3-D spherical mantle circulation models based on a seismic tomography model and strong lateral viscosity variations in the lower mantle. We demonstrate that the geoid anomalies are strongly affected by the presence of pPv because of phase-dependent viscosity changes relative to the surrounding mantle. Whereas geoid heights above subduction zones are increased for high-viscosity pPv, the presence of weak pPv reduces them, thereby improving the fit to the observed geoid. An investigation using two different tomography models, different pPv density contrasts, and the presence or absence of a global thermal boundary layer and of lateral viscosity variations in the lower mantle demonstrates the various effects of weak pPv on the geoid.},

  abstract = {Seismic synthetic records represent wave-front components which contain abundant damageable directional information about important geologic substances. However, the information is often polluted by random noises. Unlike coherent noise, random noise may be incoherent in space and time, and sometimes unpredictable. One of the main tasks in seismic denoising is to eliminate the random noise and useless interferential wave components while preserving or recovering the important seismic features. In this paper, we investigate multi-resolution (MR) methods including wavelets, contourlets and curvelets for seismic denoising of random noise. Discussions and interpretations for these methods are presented in detail to evaluate their performances. Furthermore, a combination scheme of wavelets and curvelets is applied to seismic random denoising by solving an l1 norm optimization problem. The combined scheme aims at taking advantage of the respective merits of wavelets and curvelets in order to obtain better effects. Experimental results indicate that the directional wavelets such as contourlets and curvelets are prominent for seismic profiles containing textural features and the combination method shows promising performances than individual transforms.},

  abstract = {We present a new, 3D description of crust and upper mantle velocity structure in southern California implemented as a Unified Structural Representation (USR). The USR is comprised of detailed basin velocity descriptions that are based on tens of thousands of direct velocity (Vp, Vs) measurements and incorporates the locations and displacement of major fault zones that influence basin structure. These basin descriptions were used to developed tomographic models of crust and upper mantle velocity and density structure, which were subsequently iterated and improved using 3D waveform adjoint tomography. A geotechnical layer (GTL) based on Vs30 measurements and consistent with the underlying velocity descriptions was also developed as an optional model component. The resulting model provides a detailed description of the structure of the southern California crust and upper mantle that reflects the complex tectonic history of the region. The crust thickens eastward as Moho depth varies from 10 to 40 km reflecting the transition from oceanic to continental crust. Deep sedimentary basins and underlying areas of thin crust reflect Neogene extensional tectonics overprinted by transpressional deformation and rapid sediment deposition since the late Pliocene. To illustrate the impact of this complex structure on strong ground motion forecasting, we simulate rupture of a proposed M 7.9 earthquake source in the Western Transverse Ranges. The results show distinct basin amplification and focusing of energy that reflects crustal structure described by the USR that is not captured by simpler velocity descriptions. We anticipate that the USR will be useful for a broad range of simulation and modeling efforts, including strong ground motion forecasting, dynamic rupture simulations, and fault system modeling. The USR is available through the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) website (http://www.scec.org).},

Indeed, PKJKP can only be seen in synthetic seismograms when differences are taken between two sets of synthetics generated from Earth models with slightly different innercore shear velocities. These results suggest that routine observation of PKJKP is unlikely and that reported observations, if real, must have resulted from exceptional focusing effects or inner-core attenuation much less that current models.},

We produce isotropic Rayleigh wave group and phase speed maps with uncertainty estimates from 8 to 50 s period across the entire region of study, and extend them to 70 s period where earthquake tomography is performed. Maps of azimuthal anisotropy are estimated simultaneously to minimize anisotropic bias in the isotropic maps, but are not discussed here. The 3D model is produced using a Bayesian Monte Carlo formalism covering all of China, extending eastwards through the Korean Peninsula, into the marginal seas, to Japan. We define the final model as the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution at each location on a 0.5{$\smwhtcircle$} \texttimes{} 0.5{$\smwhtcircle$} grid from the surface to 150 km depth. Surface wave dispersion data do not strongly constrain internal interfaces, but shear wave speeds between the discontinuities in the crystalline crust and uppermost mantle are well determined. We design the resulting model as a reference model, which is intended to be useful to other researchers as a starting model, to predict seismic wave fields and observables and to predict other types of data (e.g. topography, gravity). The model and the data on which it is based are available for download. In addition, the model displays a great variety and considerable richness of geological and tectonic features in the crust and in the uppermost mantle deserving of further focus and continued interpretation.},

It's effective to resolve the intermediate lateral scale topography (hundreds of km) with short period core reflected seismic phases (ScP) due to their small Fresnel-zones at short epicentral distances ({$<$}3336 km (30\textdegree )). We developed a method based on the ray theory and representation theorem to calculate short period ScP synthetics for intermediate lateral scale CMB topography. The CMB topography we introduced here is axisymmetric and specified with two parameters: H (height) and L (diameter, or lateral length scale). Our numerical computation shows that a bump (H {$>$} 0) and dip (H {$<$} 0) model would cause defocusing/weakening and focusing/amplifying effects on ScP amplitude. Moreover, the effect of frequency and combination of L and H are quantified with the amplification coefficients. Then we applied this method to estimate a possible CMB topography beneath northeastern Japan, and a CMB model with L = 140 km, H = 1.2 km overall matches the observed pattern of 2D PcP/ScP amplitude ratios. However, it is difficult to totally rule out other factors that may also affect PcP/ScP pattern because of limitation of ray-based algorithms we used here. A hybrid method combining ray theory and numerical method is promising for studying complicated 3D structure and CMB topography in the future.},

We also show that, by dividing ambient seismic records into shorter (i.e., 2700 s) and overlapping (70\%) time windows, before the cross-correlation procedure, we can improve the quality and stability of the empirical Green's functions generated. Consequently, 73 days (equivalent to 22\% of the total time period for the dataset) of nonconsecutive ambient seismic-noise time windows have been used to retrieve core-phase empirical Green's functions in a 5\textendash 10 s period band.},

  abstract = {A combination of geological evidence (in the form of hydrothermal vein systems in exhumed fault systems) and geophysical information around active faults supports the localized invasion of near-lithostatically overpressured aqueous fluids into lower portions of the crustal seismogenic zone which commonly extends to depths between 10 and 20 km. This is especially the case for compressional\textendash transpressional tectonic regimes which, beside leading to crustal thickening and dewatering through prograde metamorphism, are also better at containing overpressure and are `load-strengthening' (mean stress rising with increasing shear stress), the most extreme examples being associated with areas undergoing active compressional inversion where existing faults are poorly oriented for reactivation. In these circumstances, `fault-valve' action from ascending overpressured fluids is likely to be widespread with fault failure dual-driven by a combination of rising fluid pressure in the lower seismogenic zone lowering fault frictional strength, as well as rising shear stress. Localized fluid overpressuring nucleates ruptures at particular sites, but ruptures on large existing faults may extend well beyond the regions of intense overpressure. Postfailure, enhanced fracture along fault rupture zones promotes fluid discharge through the aftershock period, increasing fault frictional strength before hydrothermal sealing occurs and overpressures begin to reaccumulate. The association of rupture nucleation sites with local concentrations of fluid overpressure is consistent with selective invasion of overpressured fluid into the roots of major fault zones and with observed non-uniform spacing of major hydrothermal vein systems along exhumed brittle\textendash ductile shear zones. A range of seismological observations in compressional\textendash transpressional settings are compatible with this hypothesis. There is a tendency for large crustal earthquakes to be associated with extensive (L\,\textasciitilde\,100\textendash 200 km) low-velocity zones in the lower seismogenic crust, with more local Vp/Vs anomalies (L\,\textasciitilde\,10\textendash 30 km) associated with rupture nucleation sites. In some instances, these low-velocity zones also exhibit high electrical conductivity. Systematic, rigorous evaluation is needed to test how widespread these associations are in different tectonic settings, and to see whether they exhibit time-dependent behaviour before and after major earthquake ruptures.},

This earthquake resulted from the rupture of five major and many minor right-lateral faults near the southern end of the eastern California shear zone, just north of the San Andreas fault. Its M(w) 6.1 preshock and M(w) 6.2 aftershock had their own aftershocks and foreshocks. Surficial geological observations are consistent with local and far-field seismologic observations of the earthquake. Large surficial offsets (as great as 6 meters) and a relatively short rupture length (85 kilometers) are consistent with seismological calculations of a high stress drop (200 bars), which is in turn consistent with an apparently long recurrence interval for these faults.},

  abstract = {Topography and gravity are geophysical fields whose joint statistical structure derives from interface-loading processes modulated by the underlying mechanics of isostatic and flexural compensation in the shallow lithosphere. Under this dual statistical-mechanistic viewpoint an estimation problem can be formulated where the knowns are topography and gravity and the principal unknown the elastic flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. In the guise of an equivalent 'effective elastic thickness', this important, geographically varying, structural parameter has been the subject of many interpretative studies, but precisely how well it is known or how best it can be found from the data, abundant nonetheless, has remained contentious and unresolved throughout the last few decades of dedicated study. The popular methods whereby admittance or coherence, both spectral measures of the relation between gravity and topography, are inverted for the flexural rigidity, have revealed themselves to have insufficient power to independently constrain both it and the additional unknown initial-loading fraction and load-correlation factors, respectively. Solving this extremely ill-posed inversion problem leads to non-uniqueness and is further complicated by practical considerations such as the choice of regularizing data tapers to render the analysis sufficiently selective both in the spatial and spectral domains. Here, we rewrite the problem in a form amenable to maximum-likelihood estimation theory, which we show yields unbiased, minimum-variance estimates of flexural rigidity, initial-loading fraction and load correlation, each of those separably resolved with little a posteriori correlation between their estimates. We are also able to separately characterize the isotropic spectral shape of the initial-loading processes. Our procedure is well-posed and computationally tractable for the two-interface case. The resulting algorithm is validated by extensive simulations whose behaviour is well matched by an analytical theory with numerous tests for its applicability to real-world data examples.},

Such a basis of simultaneously spatially and spectrally concentrated functions should be a useful data analysis and representation tool in a variety of geophysical and planetary applications, as well as in medical imaging, computer science, cosmology, and numerical analysis. The spherical Slepian functions can be found by solving either an algebraic eigenvalue problem in the spectral domain or a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain. The associated eigenvalues are a measure of the spatiospectral concentration. When the concentration region is an axisymmetric polar cap, the spatiospectral projection operator commutes with a Sturm-Liouville operator; this enables the eigenfunctions to be computed extremely accurately and efficiently, even when their area-bandwidth product, or Shannon number, is large. In the asymptotic limit of a small spatial region and a large spherical harmonic bandwidth, the spherical concentration problem reduces to its planar equivalent, which exhibits self-similarity when the Shannon number'is kept invariant.},

This effect is in fact measurable with current instruments. For example, the agreement between data and synthetics computed in a tomographic model is often not as good for rotation as it is for displacement. Here, we use the theory of homogenization to explain why small-scale heterogeneities strongly affect wavefield gradients, but not the wavefield itself. We show that at any receiver measuring wavefield gradient, small-scale heterogeneities cause the wavefield gradient to couple with strain through a coupling tensor J. Furthermore, we show that this J is (1) independent of source, (2) independent of time, but (3) only dependent on the receiver location. Consequently, we can invert for J based on an effective model for which synthetics fit displacement data reasonably well. Once inverted, J can be used to correct rotations at that receiver for other sources. Results of the correction are shown for synthetic rotational receivers and for the ring laser located in Wettzell, Germany. We find that compared to synthetics, the synthetics corrected through J are a better fit to the rotation data. Although results here are derived for rotations, they can be extended to receivers measuring any wavefield gradient.},

However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with fine detail, and fail to represent a signal's spatial and temporal derivatives, despite the fact that these are essential to many physical signals defined implicitly as the solution to partial differential equations. We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or SIRENs, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze SIREN activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, and their derivatives. Further, we show how SIRENs can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. Lastly, we combine SIRENs with hypernetworks to learn priors over the space of SIREN functions. Please see the project website for a video overview of the proposed method and all applications.},

This concept is called seismic interferometry. Of all these noise sources, those for whom the travel time difference for propagation to the two receivers is in the stationary phase zone, give the dominant contribution. In this paper we analyze the stationary phase properties when one receiver is at a caustic for waves leaving the other receiver. A simple model for a waveguide and a general treatment of caustics show that, at a caustic, the curvature of the travel time difference at the stationary phase zone vanishes. As a result the stationary phase region is considerably wider at a caustic than at other points, and it is more likely that noise sources are present in the stationary phase region. This explains why it is easier to extract waves from seismic interferometry when the receivers are at caustics such as antipodal receivers on the Earth.},

  abstract = {[1] Using a regional GPS data set including similar to 190 stations in Asia, from Nepal to eastern Indonesia and spanning 11 years, we update the present-day relative motion between the Indian and Sundaland plates and discuss the deformation taking place between them in Myanmar. Revisiting measurements acquired on the Main Boundary Thrust in Nepal, it appears that points in southern Nepal exhibit negligible deformation with respect to mainland India. Including these points, using a longer time span than previous studies, and making an accurate geodetic mapping in the newest reference frame allows us to refine the present-day Indian motion. Our results confirm that the current motion of India is slower than predicted by the NUVEL-1A model, and in addition our India-Eurasia motion is significantly ( similar to 5 mm/yr) slower than previous geodetic determinations. This new Indian motion, combined with a refined determination of the Sundaland motion, gives way to a relative India-Sunda angular velocity of 20.2 degrees N, 26.1 degrees E, 0.370 degrees/Myr in ITRF2000, predicting a relative motion of 35 mm/yr oriented N10 degrees at the latitude of Myanmar. There, the Sagaing Fault accommodates only 18 mm/yr of right-lateral strike slip, only half of the shear component of motion. We present two models addressing how and where the remaining deformation may occur. A first model of distributed deformation implies convergence on the Arakan subduction ( the northern continuation of the now famous Sumatra-Andaman Trench) and wrench faulting in the Arakan wedge. The second model uses localized deformation, where deformation observed west of the Sagaing Fault is entirely due to elastic loading on a faster and oblique Arakan subduction ( 23 mm/yr). This latter model predicts that a major earthquake of M(w) 8.5 may occur every century on this segment of the subduction.},

This approach rests on the assumption that P data are sufficiently sensitive to thermal heterogeneity, and that compositional heterogeneity, albeit important in localized regions of the mantle (e.g. within the D region), is not sufficiently strong to govern the pattern of mantle-wide convection and hence the CMB topography. The resulting tomographic maps of CMB topography are physically sound, and they resolve the known discrepancy between images obtained from classic tomography on the basis of core-reflected and core-refracted seismic phases. Since the coefficients of mantle velocity structure are the only free parameters of the inversion, this joint tomography\textendash geodynamics approach reduces the number of parameters; nevertheless the corresponding mantle models fit the seismic data as well as the purely seismic ones.},

We adopt a recently published method which takes into account the geodynamic coupling between mantle heterogeneity and core-mantle boundary (CMB) topography by viscous flow, where sensitivity of the seismic travel times to the CMB is accounted for implicitly in the inversion (i.e. the CMB topography is not explicitly inverted for). The seismic maps of the Earth's mantle and CMB topography that we derive can explain the inverted seismic data while being physically consistent with each other. The approach involved scaling P-wave velocity (more sensitive to the CMB) to density anomalies, in the assumption that mantle heterogeneity has a purely thermal origin, so that velocity and density heterogeneity are proportional to one another. On the other hand, it has sometimes been suggested that S-wave velocity might be more directly sensitive to temperature, while P heterogeneity is more strongly influenced by chemical composition. In the present study, we use only S-, and not P-velocity, to estimate density heterogeneity through linear scaling, and hence the sensitivity of core-reflected P phases to mantle structure. Regardless of whether density is more closely related to P- or S-velocity, we think it is worthwhile to explore both scaling approaches in our efforts to explain seismic data. The similarity of the results presented in this study to those obtained by scaling P-velocity to density suggests that compositional anomaly has a limited impact on viscous flow in the deep mantle.},

Array-derived spatial wavefield gradient data to estimate, for example, strain and rotation components of the wavefield usually suffer from receiver perturbations, such as varying sensor coupling and/or differences in the instrument channel responses. We present a novel methodology to compute spatial seismic wavefield gradient data in the presence of receiver specific perturbation effects. We simultaneously invert the seismic wavefield recorded with an array consisting of closely spaced sensors for the spatial wavefield derivatives and station specific frequency-dependent calibration filters that remove the local receiver perturbations. Using synthetic and field data, we demonstrate that our scheme has the potential to significantly improve gradient estimation results for arrays with a low number of stations suitable, for instance, for land seismic exploration. The extracted calibration filters do not only correct for receiver perturbations but also partly compensate for the truncation error of the Taylor series expansion about the central (master) station of the array. The application of the calibration filters results in gradient estimates that are more accurate compared to conventional approaches. Multiple source recordings are used for reducing the trade-off between the extracted receiver perturbation filters and the spatial wavefield derivatives in the proposed inversion scheme.},

  abstract = {Frequency-domain wavefield solutions corresponding to the anisotropic acoustic wave equations can be used to describe the anisotropic nature of the earth. To solve a frequency-domain wave equation, we often need to invert the impedance matrix. This results in a dramatic increase in computational cost as the model size increases. It is even a bigger challenge for anisotropic media, where the impedance matrix is far more complex. To address this issue, we use the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain wavefield solutions for an acoustic wave equation for transversely isotropic (TI) media with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). PINNs utilize the concept of automatic differentiation to calculate its partial derivatives. Thus, we use the wave equation as a loss function to train a neural network to provide functional solutions to form of the acoustic VTI wave equation. Instead of predicting the pressure wavefields directly, we solve for the scattered pressure wavefields to avoid dealing with the point source singularity. We use the spatial coordinates as input data to the network, which outputs the real and imaginary parts of the scattered wavefields and auxiliary function. After training a deep neural network (NN), we can evaluate the wavefield at any point in space instantly using this trained NN. We demonstrate these features on a simple anomaly model and a layered model. Additional tests on a modified 3D Overthrust model and a model with irregular topography also show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We show how the ambient seismic wave field can be used to overcome these limitations. We present a regional-scale analysis of core-mantle boundary reflections (ScS) under Mexico. We show that body wave arrivals (i.e., P and ScS) are retrieved from higher-order cross correlations (C3), a technique that provides a more uniform and controlled source distribution using the scattered waves of the coda of classical ambient field cross correlations (C1). Then, we extract ScS traveltimes along a dense linear array in Mexico and find that lithospheric lateral heterogeneity, such as the subducting Cocos slab beneath Mexico, may have a strong impact on ScS traveltimes. In parallel, we show that lateral heterogeneity such as a possible ultralow velocity zone (ULVZ) near the core-mantle boundary might also affect, although to a lesser extent, the traveltime anomalies. Our results and interpretation are supported through numerical simulations that account for slab and ULVZ properties.},

Within planetary materials, which are mainly natural ceramics, frictional melting occurs at high strain rates (typically {$>$}10(-2) s(-1)) and at slip velocities greater than 0.1 m s(-1). The pathway to friction melting is controlled by the mechanical properties of a rock's constituent minerals, especially fracture toughness. Minerals with the lowest fracture toughnesses and breakdown temperatures are preferentially comminuted and fused to form the melt. The product is a polyphase suspension comprising mineral and rock fragments enclosed in a liquid matrix. This cools to form the rock type known as pseudotachylyte, and at even higher strain rates, it forms shock veins in meteorites and in impact craters, which may contain high-pressure mineral polymorphs. The generation of melt on sliding surfaces can lubricate earthquake faults, facilitate the post-shock modification of impact craters, and make landslides more hazardous.},

In the arctic tundra, snow cover persists into the spring after air temperatures and light increase to levels suitable for photosynthesis of vascular plants in the absence of snow cover. We found significant photosynthetic activity in four arctic evergreen species under springtime snow. This activity was facilitated by favorable conditions in the subnivean environment, where CO2 concentrations are elevated, temperatures are often above freezing, and light levels are sufficient to drive photosynthesis. Diurnal changes in CO2 concentration under the snow and light responses of snow-covered ecosystem CO2 fluxes provide supporting evidence of carbon gain at the ecosystem level. This activity allows evergreens to rapidly increase photosynthesis upon snowmelt and reduces wintertime losses of carbon from arctic ecosystems. The loss of these species under predicted scenarios of climate change could have serious implications for tundra carbon balance, potentially increasing carbon losses.},

Many methods have been employed to investigate the magma ascent rate in volcanic eruptions, and most rely on equilibrium thermodynamics. Combining the mixed H2O-CO2 solubility model with the diffusivities of both H2O and CO2 for normal rhyolitic melt, we model the kinetics of H2O and CO2 in rhyolitic eruptions that involve nonlinear decompression rates. Our study focuses on the effects of the total magma ascent time, the nonlinearity of decompression paths, and the influence of different initial CO2/H2O content on the posteruptive H2O and CO2 concentration profiles around bubbles within the melt. Our results show that, under most circumstances, volatile diffusion profiles do not constrain a unique solution for the decompression rate of magmas during an eruption, but, instead, provide a family of decompression paths with a well-defined trade-off between ascent time and nonlinearity. An important consequence of our analysis is that the common assumption of a constant decompression rate (averaged value) tends to underestimate the actual magma ascent time.},

  abstract = {D" represents one of the most dramatic thermal and compositional layers within our planet. In particular, global tomographic models display relatively fast patches at the base of the mantle along the circum-Pacific which are generally attributed to slab debris. Such distinct patches interact with the bridgmanite (Br) to post-bridgmanite (PBr) phase boundary to generate particularly strong heterogeneity at their edges. Most seismic observations for the D" come from the lower mantle S wave triplication (Scd). Here we exploit the USArray waveform data to examine one of these sharp transitions in structure beneath Alaska. From west to east beneath Alaska, we observed three different characteristics in D": (1) the western region with a strong Scd, requiring a sharp delta Vs = 2.5\% increase; (2) the middle region with no clear Scd phases, indicating a lack of D" (or thin Br-PBr layer); and (3) the eastern region with strong Scd phase, requiring a gradient increase in delta Vs. To explain such strong lateral variation in the velocity structure, chemical variations must be involved. We suggest that the western region represents relatively normal mantle. In contrast, the eastern region is influenced by a relic slab that has subducted down to the lowermost mantle. In the middle region, we infer an upwelling structure that disrupts the Br-PBr phase boundary. Such an interpretation is based upon a distinct pattern of travel time delays, waveform distortions, and amplitude patterns that reveal a circular-shaped anomaly about 5 degrees across which can be modeled synthetically as a plume-like structure rising about 400 km high with a shear velocity reduction of similar to 5\%, similar to geodynamic modeling predictions of upwellings.},

Am. 88 (1998) 722] grouped in 29,837 summary rays to constrain lateral variation in the depth to the core\textendash mantle boundary (CMB). We assumed a homogeneous outer core, and the data were corrected for mantle structure and inner-core anisotropy. Inversions of separate data sets yield amplitude variations of up to 5 km for PcP, PKPab, PKPbc, and PKKP and 13 km for PKPdf. This is larger than the CMB undulations inferred in geodetic studies and, moreover, the PcP results are not readily consistent with the inferences from PKP and PKKP. Although the source\textendash receiver ambiguity for the core-refracted phases can explain some of it, this discrepancy suggest that the travel-time residuals cannot be explained by topography alone. The wavespeed perturbations in the tomographic model used for the mantle corrections might be too small to fully account for the trade off between volumetric heterogeneity and CMB topography. In a second experiment we therefore re-applied corrections for mantle structure outside a basal 290 km-thick layer and inverted all data jointly for both CMB topography and volumetric heterogeneity within this layer. The resultant CMB model can explain PcP, PKP, and PKKP residuals and has approximately 0.2 km excess core ellipticity, which is in good agreement with inferences from free core nutation observations. Joint inversion yields a peak-to-peak amplitude of CMB topography of about 3 km, and the inversion yields velocity variations of {$\pm$}5\% in the basal layer. The latter suggests a strong trade-off between topography and volumetric heterogeneity, but uncertainty analyses suggest that the variation in core radius can be resolved. The spherical averages of all inverted topographic models suggest that the data are best fit if the actual CMB radius is 1.5 km less than in the Earth reference model used (i.e. the average outer core radius would be 3478 km).},

If there exists a thick sedimentary layer, however, reversal of the sign of vertical eigenfunction occurs near the surface, resulting in prograde Rayleigh-wave particle motion at the surface. We show that, for structures similar to those found in the Los Angeles basin (with thickness up to 8 km), surface prograde motion may occur within the frequency band 0.05-0.3 Hz. Although it has been suggested that the effect of gravity on waves in unconsolidated surface layer may be important, partitioning of energy between the elatic and gravitational energy shows that the gravitational energy is less than I per cent and thus is not important. The phenomenon is caused by elastic effects, mainly caused by extremely slow shallow seismic velocities. Observation of prograde elliptical particle motion may be difficult, however, because particle motion is largely horizontal and high microseismic noise exists in the same frequency band.},

This ratio, measured as a function of frequency, has been extensively analysed for shallow crustal structure study in earthquake engineering and applied seismology. This quantity, termed the ZH ratio in this paper, may be useful for deep earth structure study and its feasibility for the frequency range between 0.004 and 0.05 Hz (period 20-250 s) is explored in this paper. For depth sensitivity kernels, we demonstrate that a numerical approach is practical and provides sufficient accuracy for structural inversion. Depth extent of sensitivity kernels are about half of depth extent in phase velocity kernels, indicating that the ZH ratio is useful for studying the lithospheric structure. Two observational approaches for measurement of the ZH ratio are presented; the first approach uses simple envelope amplitude ratio and the second approach uses waveform correlation technique between vertical and horizontal components. The ZH ratio data alone only constrains structure beneath seismic stations but recent densification of seismic networks may make it possible to extend the analysis to regional scale structure. A greater opportunity may exist in combination of the ZH ratio method and the phase and group velocity measurements.},

  abstract = {A moment tensor is a symmetric matrix that expresses the source for a seismic event. The fundamental lune is a certain subset of the unit sphere whose points represent the source types for all moment tensors. Familiar source types such as double couple or pure isotropic have natural locations on the lune. Although the lune consists only of source types, it serves as a low-dimensional outline of moment tensor space as a whole. For each subset B of the lune we therefore consider the associated set [B]U of unit moment tensors that have their source types in B; we wish to get a sense of [B]U from looking at B. We succeed in calculating both the angular diameter and the volume of [B]U. We also calculate the angular diameter and the volume of the set [{$\Lambda$}]U of unit moment tensors that have source type {$\Lambda$}, and we plot the results as contours on the lune. We show that great circle arc lengths on the lune are closely related to angles between moment tensors, and that arc length on the lune gives a natural measure of difference in source type. We show how to calculate volume elements for a variety of moment tensor coordinates. Volumes are relevant in part because we equate fractional volume with the probability that expresses randomness. We thus can find the probability that a random moment tensor have its source type in a given subset of the lune. Our results have implications for estimating moment tensor uncertainties, but we do not pursue them in this paper.},

Because the adopted spherical wavelets are analytically differentiable, spatial gradient tensor quantities such as dilatation rate, strain rate and rotation rate can be directly computed using the same coefficients. In a series of synthetic and real examples, we illustrate the benefit of the multiscale approach, in particular, the inherent ability of the method to localize a given deformation field in space and scale as well as to detect outliers in the set of observations. This approach has the added benefit of being able to locally match the smallest resolved process to the local spatial density of observations, thereby both maximizing the amount of derived information while also allowing the comparison of derived quantities at the same scale but in different regions. We also consider the vertical component of the velocity field in our synthetic and real examples, showing that in some cases the spatial gradients of the vertical velocity field may constitute a significant part of the deformation. This formulation may be easily applied either regionally or globally and is ideally suited as the spatial parametrization used in any automatic time-dependent geodetic transient detector.},

Mineral physics data on the isotropic \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend lnVS/\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend lnVP ratio are taken into account in the form of a regularization constraint. The relationship between VP and VS that we observe in the top 300 km of the mantle has important thermochemical implications. Back-arc basins in the Western Pacific are characterized by large VP/VS and not extremely low VS at {$\sim$}150 km depth, consistently with presence of water. Most pronounced anomalies are located in the Sea of Japan, in the back-arc region of the Philippine Sea, and in the South China Sea. Our results indicate the effectiveness of slab-related processes to hydrate the mantle and suggest an important role of Pacific plate subduction also for the evolution of the South China Sea. We detect lateral variations in composition within the continental lithospheric mantle. Regions that have been subjected to rifting, collisions, and flood basalt events are underlain by relatively large VP/VS ratio compared to undeformed Precambrian regions, consistently with a lower degree of chemical depletion. Compositional variations are also observed in deep lithosphere. At {$\sim$}200 km depth, mantle beneath Australia and African cratons has comparable positive VS anomalies with other continental regions, but VP is {$\sim$}1\% higher.},

  abstract = {Theoretical analysis predicts that enhanced erosion related to late Cenozoic global cooling can act as a first-order influence on the internal dynamics of mountain building, leading to a reduction in orogen width and height. The strongest response is predicted in orogens dominated by highly efficient alpine glacial erosion, producing a characteristic pattern of enhanced erosion on the windward flank of the orogen and maximum elevation controlled by glacier equilibrium line altitude, where long-term glacier mass gain equals mass loss. However, acquiring definitive field evidence of an active tectonic response to global climate cooling has been elusive. Here we present an extensive new low-temperature thermochronologic data set from the Patagonian Andes, a high-latitude active orogen with a well-documented late Cenozoic tectonic, climatic and glacial history. Data from 38 degrees S to 49 degrees S record a marked acceleration in erosion 7 to 5 Myr ago coeval with the onset of major Patagonian glaciation and retreat of deformation from the easternmost thrust front. The highest rates and magnitudes of erosion are restricted to the glacial equilibrium line altitude on the windward western flank of the orogen, as predicted in models of glaciated critical taper orogens where erosion rate is a function of ice sliding velocity. In contrast, towards higher latitudes (49 degrees S to 56 degrees S) a transition to older bedrock cooling ages signifies much reduced late Cenozoic erosion despite dominantly glacial conditions here since the latest Miocene. The increased height of the orogenic divide at these latitudes (well above the equilibrium line altitude) leads us to conclude that the southernmost Patagonian Andes represent the first recognized example of regional glacial protection of an active orogen from erosion, leading to constructive growth in orogen height and width.},

Taking the EPM93 3D model as our starting model, we invert the arrival-time data from about 2100 earthquakes and 250 shots recorded on both permanent network and temporary stations in a region 130 km northeast\textendash southwest by 120 km northwest\textendash southeast. We include catalog picks and cross-correlation and catalog differential times in the inversion, using the double-difference tomography method of Zhang and Thurber (2003). The principal Vp features reported by EPM93 and Michelini and McEvilly (1991) are recovered, but with locally improved resolution along the San Andreas Fault (SAF) and near the active-source profiles. We image the previously identified strong wavespeed contrast (faster on the southwest side) across most of the length of the SAF, and we also improve the image of a high Vp body on the northeast side of the fault reported by EPM93. This narrow body is at about 5- to 12-km depth and extends approximately from the locked section of the SAF to the town of Parkfield. The footwall of the thrust fault responsible for the 1983 Coalinga earthquake is imaged as a northeast-dipping high wavespeed body. In between, relatively low wavespeeds (Ͻ5 km/sec) extend to as much as 10-km depth. We use this model to derive absolute locations for about 16,000 earthquakes from 1966 to 2005 and high-precision double-difference locations for 9,000 earthquakes from 1984 to 2005, and also to determine focal mechanisms for 446 earthquakes. These earthquake locations and mechanisms show that the seismogenic fault is a simple planar structure. The aftershock sequence of the 2004 mainshock concentrates into the same structures defined by the pre-2004 seismicity, confirming earlier observations (Waldhauser et al., 2004) that the seismicity pattern at Parkfield is long lived and persists through multiple cycles of mainshocks.},

  abstract = {The efficient computation of finite-frequency traveltime and amplitude sensitivity kernels for velocity and attenuation perturbations in global seismic tomography poses problems both of numerical precision and of validity of the paraxial approximation used. We investigate these aspects, using a local model parameterization in the form of a tetrahedral grid with linear interpolation in between grid nodes. The matrix coefficients of the linear inverse problem involve a volume integral of the product of the finite-frequency kernel with the basis functions that represent the linear interpolation. We use local and global tests as well as analytical expressions to test the numerical precision of the frequency and spatial quadrature. There is a trade-off between narrowing the bandpass filter and quadrature accuracy and efficiency. Using a minimum step size of 10 km for S waves and 30 km for SS waves, relative errors in the quadrature are of the order of 1\% for direct waves such as S, and a few percent for SS waves, which are below data uncertainties in delay time or amplitude anomaly observations in global seismology. Larger errors may occur wherever the sensitivity extends over a large volume and the paraxial approximation breaks down at large distance from the ray. This is especially noticeable for minimax phases such as SS waves with periods {$>$} 20 s, when kernels become hyperbolic near the reflection point and appreciable sensitivity extends over thousands of km. Errors becomes intolerable at epicentral distance near the antipode when sensitivity extends over all azimuths in the mantle. Effects of such errors may become noticeable at epicentral distances {$>$} 140 degrees. We conclude that the paraxial approximation offers an efficient method for computing the matrix system for finite-frequency inversions in global tomography, though care should be taken near reflection points, and alternative methods are needed to compute sensitivity near the antipode.

Therefore we favor a model with subsurface loading and interpret this to be due to underplating of mafic material at the base of the crust, a hypothesis that is supported by seismic results and direct modeling of gravity data along some profiles. These results suggest that the northern and southern parts of Ninety-East Ridge were emplaced off to a ridge axis compared to the central one, which might have been emplaced on or near a spreading center. Locally compensated large topography, thick underplated crust in the central part (near Osborn Knoll), might result from an interaction of a hot spot with the extinct Wharton spreading ridge.},

  abstract = {The days when the Earth's inner core (IC) was viewed as a homogeneous solid sphere surrounded by the liquid outer core (OC) are now behind us. Due to a limited number of data sampling the IC and a lack of experimentally controlled conditions in the deep Earth studies, it has been difficult to scrutinize competitive hypotheses in this active area of research. However, a number of new concepts linking IC structure and dynamics has been proposed lately to explain different types of seismological observations. A common denominator of recent observational work on the IC is increased complexity seen in IC physical properties such as its isotropic and anisotropic structure, attenuation, inner core boundary (ICB) topography, and its rotational dynamics. For example, small-scale features have been observed to exist as a widespread phenomenon in the uppermost inner core, probably superimposed on much longer-scale features. The characterization of small-scale features sheds light on the nature of the solidification process and helps in understanding seismologically observed hemispherical dichotomy of the IC. The existence of variations in the rate and level of solidification is a plausible physical outcome in an environment where vigorous compositional convection in the OC and variations in heat exchange across the ICB may control the process of crystal growth. However, further progress is hindered by the fact that the current traveltime data of PKIKP waves traversing the IC do not allow discriminating between variations in isotropic P wave velocity and velocity anisotropy. Future studies of attenuation in the IC might provide crucial information about IC structure, although another trade-off exists\textemdash that of the relative contribution of scattering versus viscoelastic attenuation and the connection with the material properties. Future installations of dense arrays, cross paths of waves that sample the IC, and corresponding array studies will be a powerful tool to image and clearly distinguish between viscoelastic and scattering attenuation, and isotropic- and anisotropic-heterogeneity related effects on traveltimes of core-sensitive body waves. This will then inevitably contribute to a better understanding of what the IC is made of, how it solidifies and how it contributes to the generation and dynamics of the geomagnetic field.},

  abstract = {The effects of complex structure in the deep mantle and D on PKP differential traveltimes should be estimated accurately in order to reach reliable conclusions concerning the physical and chemical properties of the Earth's inner and outer core. In particular, it is important to assess how much of the data can be explained by mantle structure alone. For this purpose, we have assembled global data sets of high-quality PKP(AB\textendash DF), PKP(BC\textendash DF) and PcP\textendash P differential traveltimes measured on mostly broad-band records. The PKP(AB\textendash DF) data were inverted alone or jointly with PcP\textendash P data, to retrieve P-velocity maps of the lowermost 300 km of the mantle. Corrections for mantle structure above D were performed prior to inversion using recent tomographic models and the fit to the PKP(BC\textendash DF) data set was used to constrain damping in the inversions. We compare models obtained with and without polar PKP paths and find that their inclusion or exclusion does not significantly affect the resulting D model except under North America, where coverage is poor without polar paths. Our preferred model, obtained using PKP(AB\textendash DF) and PcP\textendash P data combined, explains over 80 per cent of the variance in PKP(AB\textendash DF), almost 60 per cent of the variance in PcP\textendash P and 27 per cent of the variance in PKP(BC\textendash DF)\textemdash a significant portion considering that the PKP(BC\textendash DF) data set was not used in the inversion. Our models are characterized by prominent fast features under mid-America and east Asia, a fast belt across the Pacific, a slow region under the southwestern Pacific and southern Africa, as well as sharp transitions from fast to slow, for instance under Alaska and the South Atlantic. The anomalous South Sandwich to Alaska data cannot fully be explained by D structure alone, unless very short-wavelength lateral variations are introduced. Models that allow for a modest level of constant transverse anisotropy in the inner core, compatible with normal mode splitting data, perform somewhat better, but still fail to explain the result of 2 s in PKP(BC\textendash DF) residuals, on these anomalous paths.},

  abstract = {Seismology has come a long way in providing insights into Earth's internal structure and dynamics. Among many forward and inverse geophysical techniques developed, full waveform modelling, seismic tomography and receiver-based studies enabled detailed imaging of Earth's subsurface. The invention of ambient noise tomography within the last two decades revolutionized studies of Earth's subsurface based on the cross-correlation of the Earth's ambient noise. That method, in particular, enabled imaging of Earth structure in places where earthquakes or receivers do not exist. At the same time, progress in imaging the Earth's deepest shells has been impeded by the lack of geometric coverage of body waves due to uneven global distribution of seismic sources and receivers and the fact that the ambient noise studies cannot reach deeper than the uppermost Earth's shells, near its surface. In seeking the ways forward, global seismologists started experimenting with cross-correlating the part of the seismograms recorded many hours after the first arrivals of body-waves, the so-called earthquake coda. As in many science disciplines, initial work on this topic resulted in controversies but also led to new realisations and discoveries that all contributed to the rise of a new paradigm \textendash{} the earthquake coda-correlation wavefield, which is the focus of this review paper. We do not attempt here to provide a review of ambient-noise correlation, although we use some familiar concepts to introduce coda-correlation. Our main goal is to review theoretical and observational work to date that resulted in a better understanding of the coda-correlation wavefield, both as a phenomenon and a powerful method. The features in global correlograms exist due to many cross-terms of reverberating body-waves, a principle fundamentally different from the reconstruction of surface waves in the ambient-noise correlograms. Once the coda-correlation wavefield is fully understood through theoretical developments, the method becomes a powerful way to study Earth's deep structure. Apart from providing a review of the most important results to date, we scrutinise the process of making global correlograms and analyse their characteristics while taking into consideration various aspects, such as the time after the earthquake, the source-receiver geometries, the level of seismicity and the type of earthquake mechanism. Furthermore, we provide practical examples on how to build correlograms and interpret correlogram features using programming language Python. Our review seeks to promote the topic of coda correlation among already experienced researchers as well as students who embark on this interesting research, which may play a central role in global and planetary seismology in the coming decades.},

In many regions, the PcP-P dataset implies short scale lateral variations that are not resolved by global tomographic models, except under eastern Eurasia, where data and models describe a broad region of fast velocity anomalies across which variations appear to be of thermal origin. In other regions, such as central America and southeastern Africa, correlated short scale lateral variations (several hundred kilometers) are observed in PcP and ScS, implying large but not excessive values for the ratio R = D ln Vs/D ln Vp (V2.5). On the other hand, in at least two instances, in the heart of the African Plume and on the edge of the Pacific Plume, variations in P and S velocities appear to be incompatible, implying strong lateral gradients across compositionally different domains, possibly also involving topography on the core\^mantle boundary. One should be cautious in estimating R at the base of the mantle from global datasets, as different smoothing and sampling of P and S datasets may result in strong biases and meaningless results. \ss{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The reconstruction of surface waves from the cross-correlation of random wavefields has recently been extensively inspected by theoretical and experimental approaches. However, the reconstruction of body waves has not been extensively studied. In this study, we present a method for extracting body waves, that is, direct P and S waves, and reflected waves from the Philippine Sea slab. We use the cross-correlation of the wavefield generated by the teleseismic S waves observed by Hi-net tiltmeters with a passband of 0.07\textendash 0.5 Hz. To enhance the contribution of the S coda, we reduced the source-time function and the deterministic phases sS, ScS and SS, and the surface wave in S coda. The records of the processed S coda observed at every station-pair are cross-correlated for each teleseismic event. The cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of different earthquakes are stacked to retrieve wavefields propagating between the station-pairs. As a result, direct P, S and the reflected waves could be extracted when the stacked CCFs are aligned as a function of distance of separation between two stations. The gradients of the traveltime curves for the direct P and S waves are approximately 5\textendash 7 and 3 km s-1, respectively. These velocities correspond to the seismic velocities of the crust or the P-wave velocity of the uppermost mantle. In order to enhance the reflected waves, we searched for the reflection points by assuming that the later phases in the CCFs are SS reflections and map the amplitudes onto the depth sections. As a result, the negative phases dipping to the north can be traced right below the region of hypocentre distribution. These negative phases probably correspond to the oceanic Moho within the Philippine Sea slab. We also show that the oceanic Moho can also be traced by assuming PP reflections. These results indicate that the CCFs plausibly contain information regarding both P and S waves propagating between the two receivers, and are capable of detecting reflected phases in addition to the direct waves.},

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm\"oller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni\~no3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880?1920 and 1960?90, and lower power during 1920?60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance.

  abstract = {Crustal magma chambers can grow to be hundreds to thousands of cubic kilometers, potentially feeding catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions. Smaller volume chambers are expected to erupt frequently and freeze quickly; a major outstanding question is how magma chambers ever grow to the sizes required to sustain the largest eruptions on Earth. We use a thermo-mechanical model to investigate the primary factors that govern the extrusive:intrusive ratio in a chamber, and how this relates to eruption frequency, eruption size, and long-term chamber growth. The model consists of three fundamental timescales: the magma injection timescale {$\tau$}in, the cooling timescale {$\tau$}cool, and the timescale for viscous relaxation of the crust {$\tau$}relax. We estimate these timescales using geologic and geophysical data from four volcanoes (Laguna del Maule, Campi Flegrei, Santorini, and Aso) to compare them with the model. In each of these systems, {$\tau$}in is much shorter than {$\tau$}cool and slightly shorter than {$\tau$}relax, conditions that in the model are associated with efficient chamber growth and simultaneous eruption. In addition, the model suggests that the magma chambers underlying these volcanoes are growing at rates between \textasciitilde 10-4 and 10-2 km3/ year, speeding up over time as the chamber volume increases. We find scaling relationships for eruption frequency and size that suggest that as chambers grow and volatiles exsolve, eruption frequency decreases but eruption size increases. These scaling relationships provide a good match to the eruptive history from the natural systems, suggesting that the relationships can be used to constrain chamber growth rates and volatile saturation state from the eruptive history alone. Plain Language Summary Magma chambers in the Earth's crust grow by incremental addition of new magma from deeper reservoirs, and over time can reach volumes that would fill the entire Grand Canyon. However, small magma chambers in the earliest stages of formation are prone to frequent eruptions and will lose heat quickly to the surrounding crust, both of which supposedly impede growth. Therefore, an important question is how magma chambers can possibly grow to such large sizes. Here we present results of physics-based modeling aimed at understanding what conditions allow magma chambers to grow. We test effects of chamber size, rate of magma supply, water content in the magma, and plasticity of the crust hosting the chamber. Results suggest that growth is promoted when chambers cool slowly and are hosted within pliable crust that can easily relax pressures that build within the chamber. Surprisingly, we found that for a particular range of crustal pliability, growth is accompanied by frequent volcanic eruptions. We compared these results to four large volcanoes in Chile, Italy, Greece, and Japan. Model predictions for eruption frequency and chamber growth rates are a good match to what we observe at these volcanoes from the rock record and active monitoring systems.},

Theorems are given to explain this effect. First, following Elliott and O'Hara and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of log((z +1)/(z -1)) in the complex plane.

  abstract = {A fundamental question of earthquake science is what produces damaging high-frequency ground motion, with the classic Brune-Haskell model postulating that abrupt fault slip causes it. However, even when amended with heterogeneous rupture, the model fails to explain observations of different sized repeating earthquakes and has challenges explaining high-frequency radiation patterns. We propose an additional cause for high-frequency earthquake spectra from elastic collisions of structures within a rupturing fault zone. The collision spectrum is set by an impact contact time proportional to the size of colliding structures so that spectra depend on fundamentally different physical parameters compared with slip models. When added to standard models, collisions can reconcile the discrepant observations since the size, shape, and orientation of structures vary between different fault zones but remain constant within a fault segment. High-frequency earthquake ground motions and damage may therefore be an outgrowth of fault-zone structure rather than sudden initiation of slip. Plain Language Summary Why do earthquakes damage buildings? Many buildings are damaged most heavily by fast, jerky ground motion rather than the longer duration rolling motions that contain most of the earthquake energy. Despite the importance of these fast, jerky motions, most frictional models for earthquakes generally underpredict how strong they are, even when heterogeneous friction and realistic roughness are accounted for. We propose that collisions of structures as they attempt to slide past each other during an earthquake may also create jerky ground motion. We find that the ground motion from collisions depends mostly on the size of the structures and does not depend on stresses within the Earth and thus gives a very different interpretation of what causes the most damaging ground motions. When incorporated with standard frictional models, the collision model explains various observations that are otherwise difficult to explain, including why some earthquakes appear to be identical in time but with larger amplitudes, why faults that have had many earthquakes have less damaging ground motions, and why earthquake damage is observed to occur more uniformly than previously predicted.},

  abstract = {Despite being 770 km away from the epicenter, observed ground motions due to the Tohoku earthquake in the Osaka Basin were unexpectedly large, with an amplification of more than a factor of 20 compared to immediately outside the basin, and including 2.7 m peak-to-peak roof displacements at one high-rise building. The local ground motions exceeded expectations based on standard computations of site response by a factor of 3, predicted frequencies of peak acceleration were off by at least 50\%, and such discrepancies have not yet been explained quantitatively. Here we show that utilizing semianalytic theory for surface-wave amplification, we are able to accurately predict both the amplitudes and frequencies of large ground amplification in the Osaka Basin using only knowledge of the local one-dimensional structure. Comparison between this simple prediction and observed amplification was not expected to be so favorable and suggests that simple one-dimensional surface-wave site amplification factors can be useful in the absence of full three-dimensional wave propagation simulations. Such surface-wave amplification factors can be included in addition to the standard measures of site-specific site amplification and should help explain strong ground motion variability in future large earthquakes that shake Osaka Basin and elsewhere in the world. Plain Language Summary Using the local structure to predict surface-wave amplification accurately explains extreme ground motion amplification in Osaka Basin during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, whereas such ground motions have been unsuccessfully modeled with standard measures of site amplification. The results demonstrate how necessary it is to include a measure of surface-wave amplification if one is to accurately predict earthquake ground motions. The approach can potentially be incorporated into new site-specific earthquake hazards analyses in nearly an identical way to which existing approaches to site amplification are already being used.},

We address this gap in the literature and here provide explicit quantitatively accurate expressions for phase velocities and Green's function amplitudes for a few commonly used empirical formulas for near-surface velocity structure. These exact expressions are found to be immediately useful in applications that use shallow phase velocities and also in applications that interpret seismic amplitudes or amplitude ratios from near-surface processes such as fluvial transport, icequakes, landslides, and volcanic tremor.},

Critical to modeling this behavior is a choice of basal rheology, where the most popular approach is to relate the ice-sheet velocity to a power-law function of basal stress. Recent experiments, however, suggest that near-grounding line tills exhibit Coulomb friction behavior. Here we address how Coulomb conditions modify ice-sheet profiles and stability criteria. The basal rheology necessarily transitions to Coulomb friction near the grounding line, due to low effective stresses, leading to changes in ice-sheet properties within a narrow boundary layer. Ice-sheet profiles 'taper off' towards a flatter upper surface, compared with the power-law case, and basal stresses vanish at the grounding line, consistent with observations. In the Coulomb case, the grounding-line ice flux also depends more strongly on flotation ice thickness, which implies that ice sheets are more sensitive to climate perturbations. Furthermore, with Coulomb friction, the ice sheet grounds stably in shallower water than with a power-law rheology. This implies that smaller perturbations are required to push the grounding line into regions of negative bed slope, where it would become unstable. These results have important implications for ice-sheet stability in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Glaciological observations of under-flooding suggest that fluid-induced hydraulic fracture of an ice sheet from its bed sometimes occurs quickly, possibly driven by turbulently flowing water in a broad sheet flow. Taking the approximation of a fully turbulent flow into an elastic ice medium with small fracture toughness, we derive an approximate expression for the crack-tip speed, opening displacement and pressure profile. We accomplish this by first showing that a Manning-Strickler channel model for resistance to turbulent flow leads to a mathematical structure somewhat similar to that for resistance to laminar flow of a power law viscous fluid. We then adapt the plane-strain asymptotic crack solution of Desroches et al. (1994) and the power law self-similar solution of Adachi and Detournay (2002) for that case to calculate the desired quantities. The speed of crack growth is shown to scale as the overpressure (in excess of ice overburden) to the power 7/6, inversely as ice elastic modulus to the power 2/3, and as the ratio of crack length to wall roughness scale to the power 1/6. We tentatively apply our model by choosing parameter values thought appropriate for a basal crack driven by the rapid drainage of a surface meltwater lake near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Making various approximations perhaps relevant to this setting, we estimate fluid inflow rate to the basal fracture and vertical and horizontal surface displacements and find order-of-magnitude agreement with observations by Das et al. (2008) associated with lake drainage. Finally, we discuss how these preliminary estimates could be improved.},

Since melt measurements are uncommon, ice ablation estimates are often based on models including the positive degree day (PDD) model. The PDD estimate is popular since it only requires air temperature as input, but suffers from the lack of physical motivation of an energy-balance model. We present a physics-based alternative to the PDD model that still only takes air/surface temperature as input. The model resembles the PDD model except accounting for time lags in ablation when cold ice needs to be warmed. The model is expressed as a differential equation with a single extra parameter related to the efficiency of heating a near-surface layer of ice. With zero thickness, the model reduces to the PDD model, providing a physical basis for the PDD model. Applying the model to data from Greenland, it improves modestly upon the PDD model, with the main improvement being better prediction of early season melting. This new model is a useful compromise, with some of the physics of more realistic models and the simplicity of a PDD model. The model should improve estimates of meltwater production and help constrain PDD parameters when empirical calibration is challenging.},

  abstract = {Cross correlation of ambient seismic noise is known to result in time series from which station-station travel-time measurements can be made. Part of the reason that these cross-correlation travel-time measurements are reliable is that there exists a theoretical framework that quantifies how these travel times depend on the features of the ambient noise. However, corresponding theoretical results do not currently exist to describe how the amplitudes of the cross correlation depend on such features. For example, currently it is not possible to take a given distribution of noise sources and calculate the cross correlation amplitudes one would expect from such a distribution. Here, we provide a ray-theoretical framework for calculating cross correlations. This framework differs from previous work in that it explicitly accounts for attenuation as well as the spatial distribution of sources and therefore can address the issue of quantifying amplitudes in noise correlation measurements. After introducing the general framework, we apply it to two specific problems. First, we show that we can quantify the amplitudes of coherency measurements, and find that the decay of coherency with station-station spacing depends crucially on the distribution of noise sources. We suggest that researchers interested in performing attenuation measurements from noise coherency should first determine how the dominant sources of noise are distributed. Second, we show that we can quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of noise correlations more precisely than previous work, and that these signal-to-noise ratios can be estimated for given situations prior to the deployment of seismometers. It is expected that there are applications of the theoretical framework beyond the two specific cases considered, but these applications await future work.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is widely used to image the Earth's subsurface and has proven to be an extremely useful tool in application to hydrological problems. Conventional smoothness-constrained inversion of ERT data is efficient and robust, and consequently very popular. However, it does not resolve well sharp interfaces of a resistivity field and tends to reduce and smooth resistivity variations. These issues can be problematic in a range of hydrological or near-surface studies, for example mapping regolith-bedrock interfaces. While fully Bayesian approaches, such as those using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, can address the above issues, their very high computation cost makes them impractical for many applications. Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) offers a computationally efficient alternative by approximating the Bayesian posterior distribution in a derivative-free manner, which means only a relatively small number of `black-box' model runs are required. Although common limitations for ensemble Kalman filter-type methods apply to EKI, it is both efficient and generally captures uncertainty patterns correctly. We propose the use of a new EKI-based framework for ERT which estimates a resistivity model and its uncertainty at a modest computational cost. Our EKI framework uses a level-set parametrization of the unknown resistivity to allow efficient estimation of discontinuous resistivity fields. Instead of estimating level-set parameters directly, we introduce a second step to characterize the spatial variability of the resistivity field and infer length scale hyperparameters directly. We demonstrate these features by applying the method to a series of synthetic and field examples. We also benchmark our results by comparing them to those obtained from standard smoothness-constrained inversion. Resultant resistivity images from EKI successfully capture arbitrarily shaped interfaces between resistivity zones and the inverted resistivities are close to the true values in synthetic cases. We highlight its readiness and applicability to similar problems in geophysics.},

  abstract = {The northern Los Angeles fault system along the southern range front of the Santa Monica Mountains includes potentially seismogenic faults directly beneath the Los Angeles metropolitan area. For a better assessment of seismic hazards, we mapped late Cenozoic faults and folds in the northern Los Angeles basin using an extensive set of oil-well and surface geologic data. The northern Los Angeles fault system developed through early to late Miocene transrotational and transtensional regimes and a Pliocene and Quaternary transpressional regime. The Santa Monica, San Vicente, and Las Cienegas faults are early to late Miocene normal faults that were later reactivated as reverse faults, suggesting that the orientation of reverse faults is largely controlled by Miocene extensional tectonics rather than by the post-Miocene stress field. Tectonic inversion occurred at the beginning of Pliocene time with the reactivation of Miocene normal faults and initiation of reverse faults. Many Pliocene contractile structures became inactive by the middle Pleistocene, and younger deformation is taken up by new active structures, including the West Beverly Hills lineament and an active strand of the Santa Monica fault. The West Beverly Hills lineament is the northernmost segment of the Newport-Inglewood fault zone, which may have propagated northward to the Santa Monica Mountains in Quaternary time. The lineament acts as a segment boundary for the active left-lateral Santa Monica-Hollywood fault system and bounds the Hollywood basin to the west. Uplift of an oxygen-isotope substage 5e marine terrace north of the city of Santa Monica and an assumed dip of {$>$}45 degrees for the Santa Monica Mountains thrust fault underlying and uplifting the Santa Monica Mountains suggest that an average dip-slip rate for the fault is {$<$}1.3 mm/yr, Crustal shortening across the northern Los Angeles fault system accounts for less than a third of the current rate of shortening between the San Gabriel Mountains and Pales Verdes Hills based on global positioning system observations.},

Moreover, the spatiotemporal data density permitted by DAS naturally appeals to seismic array processing techniques, such as beamforming for source location. However, the measurement principle of DAS is inherently different from that of conventional seismometers, providing measurements of ground strain rather than ground motion, and so the suitability of traditional seismological methods requires in-depth evaluation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a DAS array in the task of seismic beamforming, in comparison with a co-located nodal seismometer array. We find that, even though the nodal array achieves excellent performance in localising a regional ML 4.3 earthquake, the DAS array exhibits poor waveform coherence and consequently produces inadequate beamforming results that are dominated by the signatures of shallow scattered waves. We demonstrate that this behaviour is likely inherent to the DAS measurement principle, and so new strategies need to be adopted to tailor array processing techniques to this emerging measurement technology. One strategy demonstrated here is to convert the DAS strain rates to particle velocities by spatial integration using the nodal seismometer recordings as a reference, which dramatically improves waveform coherence and beamforming performance and warrants new types of ``hybrid'' array design that combine dense DAS arrays with sparse seismometer arrays.},

We document this as the Atlas of the Underworld, also accessible online at www.atlas-of-the-underworld.org, a compilation comprising subduction systems active in the past \textasciitilde 300 Myr. Deeper slabs are correlated to older geological records, assuming no relative horizontal motions between adjacent slabs following break-off, using knowledge of global plate circuits, but without assuming a mantle reference frame. The longest actively subducting slabs identified reach the depth of \textasciitilde 2500 km and some slabs have impinged on Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces in the deepest mantle. Anomously fast sinking of some slabs occurs in regions affected by long-term plume rising. We conclude that slab remnants eventually sink from the upper mantle to the core-mantle boundary. The range in subduction-age versus \textendash{} depth in the lower mantle is largely inherited from the upper mantle history of subduction. We find a significant depth variation in average sinking speed of slabs. At the top of the lower mantle average slab sinking speeds are between 10 and 40 mm/yr, followed by a deceleration to 10\textendash 15 mm/yr down to depths around 1600\textendash 1700 km. In this interval, in situ time-stationary sinking rates suggest deceleration from 20 to 30 mm/yr to 4\textendash 8 mm/yr, increasing to 12\textendash 15 mm/yr below 2000 km. This corroborates the existence of a slab deceleration zone but we do not observe long-term ({$>$} 60 My) slab stagnation, excluding long-term stagnation due to compositional effects. Conversion of slab sinking profiles to viscosity profiles shows the general trend that mantle viscosity increases in the slab deceleration zone below which viscosity slowly decreases in the deep mantle. This is at variance with most published viscosity profiles that are derived from different observations, but agrees qualitatively with recent viscosity profiles suggested from material experiments.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

Conventional cross-correlations evaluate the similarity between two signals along lag time, and they are efficiently computed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), valuable to manage the large data volumes that ambient noise applications demand. The phase cross-correlation (PCC) method contributes to increase convergence, a key issue in seismic ambient noise imaging and monitoring; however, it is much more computationally demanding. PCC evaluates similarity by subtracting the modulus of the sum and difference of the instantaneous phase of two signals. We introduce solutions to dramatically reduce the high-computational cost of PCC. We show that PCC can be rewritten as a complex cross-correlation and computed by the FFT when the moduli are raised to the power of 2, and we demonstrate PCC can improve waveform coherence and increase convergence compared with the default processing flow of 1-bit amplitude normalization and standard cross-correlation. Moreover, we develop a graphics processing unit implementation to accelerate computations when using powers other than 2 and particularly when using the power of 1. Finally, we extract Rayleigh- and body-wave signals from many years of data from seismic stations distributed worldwide using PCC without a significant increase in computational cost compared with conventional cross-correlation.},

  abstract = {We present an extensible software framework, hIPPYlib, for solution of large-scale deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with (possibly) infinite-dimensional parameter fields (which are high-dimensional after discretization). hIPPYlib overcomes the prohibitive nature of Bayesian inversion for this class of problems by implementing state-of-the-art scalable algorithms for PDE-based inverse problems that exploit the structure of the underlying operators, notably the Hessian of the log-posterior. The key property of the algorithms implemented in hIPPYlib is that the solution of the deterministic and linearized Bayesian inverse problem is computed at a cost, measured in linearized forward PDE solves, that is independent of the parameter dimension. The mean of the posterior is approximated by the MAP point, which is found by minimizing the negative log-posterior. This deterministic nonlinear least-squares optimization problem is solved with an inexact matrix-free Newton-CG method. The posterior covariance is approximated by the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log posterior evaluated at the MAP point. This Gaussian approximation is exact when the parameter-to-observable map is linear; otherwise, its logarithm agrees to two derivatives with the log-posterior at the MAP point, and thus it can serve as a proposal for Hessian-based MCMC methods. The construction of the posterior covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the Hessian of the log-likelihood. Scalable tools for sample generation are also implemented. hIPPYlib makes all of these advanced algorithms easily accessible to domain scientists and provides an environment that expedites the development of new algorithms. hIPPYlib is also a teaching tool that can be used to educate researchers and practitioners who are new to inverse problems and the Bayesian inference framework.},

We develop a manually reviewed catalog of explosions in the Utah region for 1 October 2012 to 30 June 2018 and use it to assess a newly proposed, magnitude-based depth discriminant. Within the Utah region we define 26 event clusters that are primarily associated with mine blasts but also include explosions from weapons testing and disposal. The catalog refinement process consists of confirming the explosion source labels, revising the local (ML) and coda duration (MC) magnitudes, and relocating the hypocenters. The primary features used to determine source labels are waveform characteristics such as frequency content, the proximity of the preliminary epicenter to a permitted blast region, the time of day, and prior notification from mine operators. We reviewed 2199 seismic events of which 1545 are explosions, 459 are local earthquakes, and 195 are other event types. Of the reviewed events, 127 (5.8\%) were reclassified with new labels. Over 74\% of the reviewed explosions have both ML and MC, a sizable improvement over the unreviewed catalog (65\%). The mean ML\textendash MC value for the new explosion catalog is -0:196   0:017 (95\% confidence interval) compared with a previously determined value of 0:048   0:008 for naturally occurring earthquakes in the Utah region. The shallow depths of the explosions lead to enhanced coda production, which in turn leads to anomalously large MC values. This finding confirms that ML\textendash MC is a useful metric for discriminating explosions from deeper tectonic earthquakes in Utah. However, there is significant variation in ML\textendash MC among the 26 explosion source regions, suggesting that ML\textendash MC observations should be combined with other classification metrics to achieve the best performance in distinguishing explosions from earthquakes.},

Here we show that distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) bridges critical observational gaps of seismogenic processes in Alpine terrain. Dynamic strain measurements in a 1\,km long fiber optic cable on a glacier surface produce high-quality seismograms related to glacier flow and nearby rock falls. The nearly 500 cable channels precisely locate a series of glacier stick-slip events (within 20\textendash 40\,m) and reveal seismic phases from which thickness and material properties of the glacier and its bed can be derived. As seismic measurements can be acquired with fiber optic cables that are easy to transport, install and couple to the ground, our study demonstrates the potential of DAS technology for seismic monitoring of glacier dynamics and natural hazards.},

High SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) surface waves have been extracted from cross-correlations of long-duration ambient noise across the globe. Body waves, not extracted in most of ambient noise studies, are thought to be more difficult to retrieve from regular ambient noise data processing. By stacking cross-correlations of ambient noise in 50 km inter-station distance bins in China, western United States and Europe, we observed coherent 20\textendash 100 s core phases (ScS, PKIKPPKIKP, PcPPKPPKP) and crustal-mantle phases (Pn, P, PL, Sn, S, SPL, SnSn, SS, SSPL) at distances ranging from 0 to 4 000 km. Our results show that these crustal-mantle phases show diverse characteristics due to different substructure and sources of body waves beneath different regions while the core phases are relatively robust and can be retrieved as long as stations are available. Further analysis indicates that the SNR of these body-wave phases depends on a compromise between stacking fold in spatial domain and the coherence of pre-stacked cross-correlations. Spatially stacked cross-correlations of seismic noise can provide new virtual seismograms for paths that complement earthquake data and that contain valuable information on the structure of the Earth. The extracted crustal-mantle phases can be used to study lithospheric heterogeneities and the robust core phases are significantly useful to study the deep structure of the Earth, such as detecting fine heterogeneities of the core-mantle boundary and constraining differential rotation of the inner core.},

The distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) array consisted of about 8400 m of fiber-optic cable in a shallow trench and 360 m in a well. The conventional seismometer array consisted of 238 shallowly buried threecomponent geophones. The DAS cable was laid out in three parallel zig-zag lines with line segments approximately 100 m in length and geophones were spaced at approximately 60 m intervals. Both DAS and conventional geophones recorded continuously over 15 d during which a moderate-sized earthquake with a local magnitude of 4.3 was recorded on 2016 March 21. Its epicentre was approximately 150 km south\textendash southeast of the laboratory. Several DAS line segments with co-located geophone stations were used to compare signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in both time and frequency domains and to test relationships between DAS and geophone data. The ratios were typically within a factor of five of each other with DAS SNR often greater for P-wave but smaller for S-wave relative to geophone SNR. The SNRs measured for an earthquake can be better than for active sources because the earthquake signal contains more low-frequency energy and the noise level is also lower at those lower frequencies.},

We demonstrate that coda correlation is dominated by a few contributions, most of which arise from the late-coda time window, 3 hr after the earthquake origin time. Our identification analysis confirms that the contributions are cross-terms between body waves. That represents an observational proof of the conjecture that coda-correlation features are formed due to body waves arriving at a pair of receivers with the same slowness. We further quantify the relationship between body-wave cross-terms and event-receiver geometries and Earth structure, which has significant practical implications. Our analysis demonstrates that body-wave cross-terms that contribute to the same coda-correlation feature sample the Earth along fundamentally different paths. They are significantly different depending on event locations, although the resulting time variation is quite small if the late coda (e.g. 3\textendash 9 hr after event origin time) is used. That explains why the late coda is more effective than an earlier time window in producing relatively stable features, as empirically suggested by previous studies. Our study enables quantitative and practical understanding of coda-correlation features in terms of their formation progress, and this opens a way to distill valuable information about Earth structure from coda correlation.},

  abstract = {Anisotropy of Earth's inner core provides a key role to understand its evolution and the Earth's magnetic field. Recently, using autocorrelations from earthquake's coda, we found an equatorial anisotropy of the inner-inner core (IIC), in apparent contrast to the polar anisotropy of the outer-inner core (OIC). To reduce the influence of the polar anisotropy and reduce possible contaminations from the large Fresnel zone of the PKIKP2 and PKIIKP2 phases at low frequencies, we processed coda noise of large earthquakes (10,000\textendash 40,000 s after magnitude !7.0) from stations at low latitudes (within {$\pm$}35\textdegree ) during 1990\textendash 2013. Using a number of improved procedures of both autocorrelation and cross-correlation, we extracted 52 arraystacked high-quality empirical Green's functions (EGFs), an increase of over 60\% from our previous study. The high-quality data allow us to measure the relative arrival times by automatic waveform cross correlation. The results show large variation (\$10.9 s) in the differential times between the PKIKP2 and PKIIKP2 phases. The estimated influence of the Fresnel zone is insignificant ({$<$}1.1 s), compared to the observed data variation and measurement uncertainty. The observed time residuals match very well previous IIC model with a quasi-equatorial fast axis (near Central America and the Southeast Asia) and the spatial pattern from the low-latitude measurements is similar to the previous global dataset, including the fast axis and two low-velocity open rings, thus providing further support for the equatorial anisotropy model of the IIC. Speculations for the shift of the fast axis between the OIC and the IIC include: change of deformation regimes during the inner core history, change of geomagnetic field, and a proto-inner core.},

The often-used harmonic mean approximation (HMA) makes no prior assumptions about the character of the distribution but tends to be inconsistent. The Laplace approximation is stable but makes strong, and often inappropriate, assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution. Here, I argue that the marginal likelihood can be reliably computed from a posterior sample using Lebesgue integration theory in one of two ways: 1) when the HMA integral exists, compute the measure function numerically and analyze the resulting quadrature to control error; 2) compute the measure function numerically for the marginal likelihood integral itself using a space-partitioning tree, followed by quadrature. The first algorithm automatically eliminates the part of the sample that contributes large truncation error in the HMA. Moreover, it provides a simple graphical test for the existence of the HMA integral. The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign probability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal likelihood integral directly. It uses the posterior sample to discover and tessellate the subset of the sample space that was explored and uses quantiles to compute a representative field value. When integrating directly, this space may be trimmed to remove regions with low probability density and thereby improve accuracy. This second algorithm is consistent for all proper distributions. Error analysis provides some diagnostics on the numerical condition of the results in both cases.},

  abstract = {We present a new application of a method based on the radon transform for data interpolation and signal-to-noise separation of teleseismic wavefields recorded by regional seismic arrays. The method exploits the plane wave nature of direct arrivals and receiver side scattered arrivals from regional scale structure by decomposing the recorded wavefield into a plane wave basis (linear radon transform). Casting the radon transform as an inversion problem allows the incorporation of time-dependent weighting schemes and model variance tuning which are helpful in minimizing artefacts related to the transform process while enhancing lower amplitude arrivals. The procedure begins with an estimate radon transform of the input data panel. A mute is applied in the radon domain to isolate portions of the radon panel that represent plane waves with different moveouts ({$\sim\pm$}.025 s km-1) relative to the direct arrival. The inverse transform of the estimated noise is subtracted from the input data to produce an estimate of the desired signal without plane waves following undesired moveouts, white ambient noise, and arrivals not represented well by plane waves (diffractions). Inverse transformation of estimated signal in the radon domain produces a natural way to interpolate in the data domain due to the implicit assumption that a plane wave basis provides the most compact representation of the teleseismic wavefield. This processing scheme presents an important addition to standard teleseismic imaging processing flows that attempt to exploit irregularly, sampled data.},

To overcome this difficulty, we propose a hybrid method to efficiently compute teleseismic waveforms with 3-D source-side structures. By coupling the Spectral Element Method (SEM) with the Direct Solution Method (DSM) based on the representation theorem, we are able to limit the costly SEM simulation to a small source-side region and avoid computation over the entire space of the Earth. Our hybrid method is benchmarked against 1-D DSM synthetics and 3-D SEM synthetics. We also discuss numerical difficulties in the implementation, including slow DSM convergence near source depth, discretization error, Green's function interpolation and local 3-D wavefield approximations. As a case study, we apply our hybrid method to two subduction earthquakes and show its advantage in understanding 3-D source-side effects on teleseismic P-waves. Our hybrid method reduces computational cost by more than two orders of magnitude when only source-side 3-D complexities are of concern. Thus our hybrid method is useful for a series of problems in seismology, such as imaging 3-D structures of a subducting slab or a mid-ocean ridge and studying source parameters with 3-D source-side complexities using teleseismic waveforms.},

However, low signal-to-noise ratios and uncertainties in phase arrivals hinder the application of seismic interferometry. With three arrays from the China Regional Seismic Network, South America, and the western United States, we simulate coda interferometry using the one-dimensional synthetic coda of large earthquakes (magnitude {$\geq$} 7.0) from 2005 to 2012. Compared with the cross correlations of real coda (10,000\textendash 40,000 s after earthquakes), the similarities among the simulated waveforms of the core phases (PKIKP, PKIIKP, PKPab, PKIKP2, and PKIIKP2) indicate that reverberations at first-order discontinuities constitute the major source for coda interferometry. Relative to synthesized Green's functions, the core phases derived from coda interferometry provide reliable phase information but varying amplitudes. In particular, the slownesses are generally consistent with the theoretical calculations, thereby confirming the extracted phases. The simulations prefer the 15- to 50-s period band and indicate that the earthquake distribution has an insignificant effect on the retrieval of core phases at small distances (0\textendash 8\textdegree ). Coda interferometry is scarcely affected by white noise, but it is influenced by the attenuation of the inner core. Experiments on focal mechanisms further suggest that coda signals from dip-slip earthquakes mainly contribute to the reconstruction of the core phases (except for the simulated PKPab).},

The extraction of body waves has been very limited, but recent reports have suggested promises for deep incident waves. Here we report our first observations of triplicated PKP phases (important phases for studying the Earth's core) and confirm observations of other body-wave core phases from noise correlations. We use dense seismic arrays in South America and China Regional Seismic Networks at distances from 145{$\smwhtcircle$} to the antipode. We can clearly observe different PKP branches (df, bc and ab) in stacks of the station\textendash station correlations. Both ambient noise and earthquake coda contribute to PKP phases. However, the contributions vary with frequency and with body-wave phases. At shorter periods (5\textendash 20 s), three branches of PKP (df, bc and ab) can be extracted from ambient noise and the ab phase from earthquake coda. At longer periods (15\textendash 50 s), earthquake coda are effective in generating the df branch, but not the ab branch. The generation of the PKIKP phase (df branch) from earthquake coda does not depend on earthquake focal mechanisms or focal depths. However, earthquakes far from the stations contribute more than events closer by. The best coda window is around 10 000\textendash 40 000 s and the best magnitude threshold is Mw greater than 6.8 or 6.9. The observation of triplicated PKP branches from noise correlations provides a new type of data for studying the Earth's deep interior, in particularly the inner core anisotropy, which overcomes some of the limitations of traditional earthquake-based studies (such as limited source distributions and source location errors).},

  abstract = {Studies of velocity structure in the Earth's inner core and its volumetric variations illuminate our understanding of inner core dynamics and composition. Here we use an extensive number of seismograms recorded by the Hi-net array to construct complete empirical curves of PKPBC-PKPDF differential traveltimes. The nature of these curves implies that significant variations in traveltimes are accumulated during the passage of PKPDF waves through the uppermost inner core and rules out outer core structure effects. Uniform cylindrical anisotropy of a plausible strength in the uppermost inner core can also be ruled out as a cause of the observed traveltime variations because the range of sampled ray angles is too narrow. The configuration and strength of inhomogeneities from a recent tomographic model of the lowermost mantle cannot account for the observed traveltime variations. Therefore, we infer that either variations of P wave isotropic velocity on the scale of about hundred km and less are present in the uppermost inner core or the material may be organized in distinctive anisotropic domains, and both of these features may be superimposed on long-wavelength hemispherical structure. If the former holds true, the absolute magnitude of required P wave velocity perturbations from referent values is 0.60 {$\pm$} 0.10\% in the quasi-eastern and 1.55 {$\pm$} 0.15\% in the quasi-western hemisphere (0.85 {$\pm$} 0.05\% and 1.10 {$\pm$} 0.10\%, respectively, with the lowermost mantle correction). The existence of these variations is a plausible physical outcome given that vigorous compositional convection in the outer core and variations in heat exchange across the inner core boundary may control the process of solidification.},

The use of asymptotic Green's functions for scalar wave equations provides an efficient way to calculate the Born or Rytov kernels. The 2-D sensitivity kernels enable us to incorporate the finite-frequency effects of surface waves, as well as off-great-circle propagation, in tomographic inversions for phase-speed structures. We derive examples of the 2-D sensitivity kernels both for a homogeneous background model (or a spherically symmetric model), and for a laterally heterogeneous model. The resulting distortions of the shape of the sensitivity kernels for a heterogeneous background model indicate the importance of the use of proper kernels to account of the heterogeneity in the real Earth. By combining a set of 2-D sensitivity kernels with 1-D vertical sensitivity kernels for a particular frequency range and taking the inverse Fourier transform, we can derive 3-D sensitivity kernels for surface waves in the time domain. Such 3-D kernels are useful for efficient forward modelling of surface waveforms incorporating finite-frequency effects, and will also enable us to perform direct inversion of surface waveforms into 3-D structure taking account of finite-frequency effects.},

Owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio, the seismic activities of DLFEs have not been characterized in detail; particularly, the linkage between DLFEs and shallow volcanic activity has not been understood sufficiently. In this study, numerous DLFEs have been successfully detected beneath the Hakone volcano, central Japan, by cross-correlating a template to the continuous seismic signals. The resulting seismic catalog reveals that DLFEs are activated prior to notable earthquake swarms in the shallow part of a volcano and to the crustal expansion caused by a pressure source at a depth of 7 km. Results indicate that the activation of DLFEs reflects the feeding of magmatic fluid from depth. The subsequent increment in the magmatic-fluid pressure triggers shallow volcanic activities. Plain Language Summary Deep low-frequency earthquakes (DLFEs) are ubiquitous seismic activities in the deep parts of volcanoes. This deep seismicity provides potentially useful information for assessing volcanic hazards or forecasting eruptions because DLFE is thought to be related to deep magmatism. However, owing to its low signal-to-noise ratio, such seismic activity has not been characterized in detail; therefore, its linkage to shallow volcanic activity remains unclear. We studied the DLFEs beneath Hakone, which is an active volcano in central Japan, using the matched-filter technique. We uncovered numerous DLFEs from seismic records spanning 17 years. We observed a statistically well-supported correlation between the DLFE and shallow-earthquake swarms/volcanic crustal deformation. Results revealed a recurring pattern of initially deep low-frequency seismicity, followed by expansion of the volcanic edifice and increasing shallow-earthquake swarms. This sequence reflects the migration of magmatic-fluid pressure leading to volcanic events at the surface. These findings not only help scientific enquiry but also will be useful in mitigation of volcanic hazards because DLFE activation is the precursor of shallow volcanic events.},

We then demonstrate the utility of DAS in passive earthquake seismology, including receiver function analysis, densely distributed travel time measurements, and Rayleigh wave group/phase velocity estimation. These applications can potentially be used to provide high-resolution structural images of the crust and mantle.

For studies that presented sampling locations based on infinite frequency ray theory, we approximated Fresnel zones onto a 0.58 3 0.58 grid. Results for these studies were separated according to wave type: (1) core-reflected phases, which have a single location of ULVZ sampling (ScS, ScP, PcP), (2) core waves that can sample ULVZs at the core entrance and exit locations of the wave (e.g., SPdKS, PKKP, and PKP), and (3) waves which have uncertainties of ULVZ location due to long CMB sampling paths, e.g., diffracted energy sampling over a broad region (Pdiff, Sdiff). For studies that presented specific modeled ULVZ geographical shapes or PKP scatter probability maps, we digitized the regions. We present summary maps of the ULVZ coverage, as well as published locations arguing against ULVZ presence. A key finding is that there is not a simple mapping between lowermost mantle reduced tomographic velocities and observed ULVZ locations, especially given the presence of ULVZs outside of lowermost mantle large low velocity provinces (LLVPs). Significant location uncertainty exists for some of the ULVZ imaging wave types. Nonetheless, this compilation supports a compositionally distinct origin for at least some ULVZs. ULVZs are more likely to be found near LLVP boundaries, however, their relationship to overlying surface locations of hot spots are less obvious. The new digital ULVZ database is freely available for download.},

For example, we show that global model S40RTS is locally biased toward higher amplitudes below isolated receivers where raypaths are quasi-vertical, such as on Hawaii. This leads to questions on the apparent low-velocity structure interpreted as the Hawaii hot spot. We prove that a linear Backus-Gilbert inversion scheme can bring the Earth's interior into focus through unbiased tomographic lenses, as its model estimates are constrained to be averages over the true model. It also efficiently computes the full generalized inverse required to infer both model resolution and its covariance, enabling quantitative interpretations of tomographic models.},

  abstract = {Strategies for modelling seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection traveltimes to obtain 2-D velocity and interface structure are presented along with methods for assessing the reliability of the results. Emphasis is placed on using inverse methods, but a discussion of arrival picking and classification, data uncertainties, traveltime reciprocity, crooked line geometry and the selection of a starting model is also applicable to trial-and-error forward modelling. The most important advantages of an inverse method are the ability to derive simpler models for the appropriate level of fit to the data, and the ability to assess the final model in terms of resolution, parameter bounds and non-uniqueness. Given the unique characteristics of each data set and the local earth structure, there is no single approach to modelling wide-angle data that is best. This paper describes the best modelling strategies according to (1) the model parametrization, (2) the inclusion of prior information, (3) the complexity of the earth structure, (4) the characteristics of the data, and (5) the utilization of coincident seismic reflection data. There are two natural end-member inversion styles: (1) a regular, fine-grid parametrization when seeking a minimum-structure model, and (2) an irregular grid, minimum-parameter model when considering certain forms of prior information. The former style represents the `pure' tomography approach. The latter style is closer to automated forward modelling, and can be applied best with a parameter-selective algorithm, that is, one that allows any subset of model parameters to be selected for inversion. If there is strong lateral heterogeneity in the near-surface only, layer stripping works well. If there is complexity at all depths, all model parameters should be determined simultaneously after careful construction of a starting model that allows the appropriate rays to be traced to all pick locations. The lateral spacing of model nodes to use will depend on the type of inversion and whether detailed prior information is included, but a general guideline based on model resolution when seeking a minimum-parameter model is a model node spacing equal to the shot spacing (receiver spacing for typical marine data), except perhaps in the upper layers where about half this may be necessary; node spacing is not an issue when using smoothing constraints, provided it is small enough to resolve the earth structure of interest. Traveltimes picked from pre-stack, unmigrated or migrated coincident reflection data can be (1) used to develop the starting model, (2) inverted simultaneously with the wide-angle data, or (3) inverted after modelling the wide-angle data to constrain interfaces that `float' within the velocity model. Model assessment establishes the reliability of the final model. Presenting model statistics, traveltime fits, ray diagrams and resolution kernels is useful, but can only indirectly address this issue. Direct model assessment techniques that derive alternative models that satisfactorily fit the real data are the best means of establishing the absolute bounds on model parameters and whether a particular model feature is required by the data.},

  abstract = {A method of seismic traveltime inversion for simultaneous determination of 2-D velocity and interface structure is presented that is applicable to any type of body-wave seismic data. The advantage of inversion, as opposed to trial-and-error forward modelling, is that it provides estimates of model parameter resolution, uncertainty and non-uniqueness, and an assurance that the data have been fit according to a specified norm. In addition, the time required to interpret data is significantly reduced. The inversion scheme is iterative and is based on a model parametrization and a method of ray tracing suited to the forward step of an inverse approach. The number and position of velocity and boundary nodes can be adapted to the shot-receiver geometry and subsurface ray coverage, and to the complexity of the near-surface. The model parametrization also allows ancillary amplitude information to be used to constrain model features not adequately resolved by the traveltime data alone. The method of ray tracing uses an efficient numerical solution of the ray tracing equations, an automatic determination of take-off angles, and a simulation of smooth layer boundaries that yields more stable inversion results. The partial derivatives of traveltime with respect to velocity and the depth of boundary nodes are calculated analytically during ray tracing and a damped least-squares technique is used to determine the updated parameter values, both velocities and boundary depths simultaneously. The stopping criteria and optimum number of velocity and boundary nodes are based on the trade-off between RMS traveltime residual and parameter resolution, as well as the ability to trace rays to all observations. Methods for estimating spatial resolution and absolute parameter uncertainty are presented. An example using synthetic data demonstrates the algorithm's accuracy, rapid convergence and sensitivity to realistic noise levels. An inversion of refraction and wide-angle reflection traveltimes from the 1986 IRISPASSCAL Nevada, USA (Basin and Range province) seismic experiment illustrates the methodology and practical considerations necessary for handling real data. A comparison of our final 2-D velocity model with results from studies using other 1-D and 2-D forward and inverse methods serves as a check on the validity of the inversion scheme and provides estimates of parameter uncertainties that account for the bias introduced by the modelling approach and the interpreter.},

It should significantly augment present seismic networks. For several important applications, it should be superior. It employs ordinary fiber-optic cables, but not as channels for data among separate sophisticated instruments. With DAS, the hair-thin glass fibers themselves are the sensors. Internal natural flaws serve as seismic strainmeters, kinds of seismic detector. Unused or dark fibers are common in fiber cables widespread around the globe, or in dedicated cables designed for special application, are appropriate for DAS. They can sample passing seismic waves at locations every few meters or closer along paths stretching for tens of kilometers. DAS arrays should enrich the three major areas of local and regional seismology: earthquake monitoring, imaging of faults and many other geologic formations, and hazard assessment. Recent laboratory and field results from DAS tests underscore its broad bandwidth and high-waveform fidelity. Thus, while still in its infancy, DAS already has shown itself as the working heart\textemdash or perhaps ear drums\textemdash of a valuable new seismic listening tool. My colleagues and I expect rapid growth of applications.

The data from the four seismometers during the Apollo missions vastly improved our understanding of lunar seismicity and interior. However, many outstanding scientific questions remain unresolved, largely due to the sparse data coverage and the highly scattering layer atop the Moon. Here we propose to apply a new technology, Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), in deploying ultra-dense seismic arrays on the Moon. In contrast to traditional seismometers, a single DAS instrument converts every meter of a long (currently up to 100km) optical fiber into a seismic sensor. Furthermore, fiber cables can be engineered to survive harsh lunar environments (e.g., temperature, dust) without sensitive electronics. To investigate the potential of DAS in constraining lunar seismicity sources and interior structures, we conduct numerical simulations to generate synthetic DAS data based on different proposed lunar velocity models. We find that array processing of the DAS data can effectively retrieve weak deep moon seismic phases hidden in the strong scattering waves and therefore allow us to test different hypotheses. We also evaluate the technical requirements on DAS arrays to answer critical lunar science questions.},

  abstract = {A dense seismic array, composed of over 5000 stations with an average spacing close to 120 m was deployed in Long Beach, CA, by NodalSeismic and Signal Hill Petroleum as part of a survey associated with the Long Beach oilfield. Among many interesting wave propagation effects that have been reported by others, we observe that the coda of teleseismic P waves display waves caused by obvious local scattering from the Signal Hill popup structure between strands of the Newport-Inglewood fault. The density of the seismic array allows space-based methods, such as the Curvelet transform, to be investigated to separate the teleseismic and local scattered wavefields. We decompose a synthetic wavefield composed of a teleseismic plane wave and local scattered spherical wave in the curvelet domain to test the plausibility of our curvelet analysis and then apply the technique to the Long Beach array data set. Background noise is removed by a soft thresholding method and a declustering technique is applied to separate the teleseismic and local scattered wavefield in the curvelet domain. Decomposed results illustrate that the signal-to-noise ratio of the teleseismic P wave can be significantly improved by curvelet analysis. The scattered wavefield is composed of locally propagating Rayleigh waves from the pop-up structure and from the Newport Inglewood fault itself. Observing the wavefield both in space and time clearly improves understanding of wave propagation complexities due to structural heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {The structure of subducted slabs is not well imaged in most global tomographic models with anomalies typically less than 1\%. Synthetic waveforms for such models are not noticeably different from their 1D reference models. In contrast, we find that observed teleseismic waveforms sampling slabs in the down-dip direction display multipathing features indicative of substantial structure. Such waveform complexity patterns appear distinctly different for various source locations with outer-rise events generally displaying relatively simple waveforms. Here, we model these waveform patterns for a portion of the Kuril subduction zone. The best fitting slab models have relatively fast cores (similar to 5\%) with smooth edges compatible with thermal modeling in shape. Complete seismograms for these 2D models indicate that multibounce P and S waves are slab-sensitive and can be used in refining models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {There are many features in the Earth's crust that involve a jump in physical properties across a sharp boundary. One example is the boundary of an ore body embedded in host rocks. Such well-defined boundaries are often of interest to geophysicists, however traditional minimumstructure inversion methods tend to produce blurred images of the subsurface, where sharp boundaries are not well defined. In this paper, we explore the application of a level set inversion method to recovering a sharp boundary between two slowness values, one characterizing an inclusion, for example, an ore body, the other characterizing a background, for example, host rocks, from first arrival traveltime data. The slowness values are assumed to be known, for example, from sonic logs. We consider the scenario of cross-borehole tomography in two dimensions, however the method is extendible to the 3-D tomography. We test the method on a series of synthetic examples including both fast and slow inclusions. We also investigate numerically the use of straight ray and bent ray forward modelling in the inversion for media with different velocity contrasts.},

Cross-branch mode-coupling effects are fully accounted for in the kernels; however, these effects can probably be ignored at the present level of spatial resolution in global phase-delay tomography. The narrowly concentrated spectra of the windows and tapers commonly used in global surface wave studies enable the kernels to be computed extremely efficiently.},

  abstract = {Delineating reservoir units is still a challenge for seismic approaches. Even high-resolution crosswell tomographic approaches that produce smooth velocity models to match traveltime data usually provide limited information about the boundaries of subsurface targets. A recent development of seismic traveltime tomography incorporated with a boundary-preserving regularization constraint promisingly helps to resolve ambiguities in reservoir boundaries, while allowing lateral variations. We applied a kind of boundarypreserving traveltime tomography to delineate boundaries of the reservoir and CO2-saturated zones. We chose the minimum gradient support as the regularization to preserve boundaries of the geologic target by penalizing smaller model gradients and smoothing small model variations caused by noise. We evaluated several synthetic and real data applications. Synthetic examples demonstrated that the boundary-preserving algorithm produced improved recovery of the profile shape and velocity values of the blocky targets. Two real applications were for delineating the top and base of the reservoir in the King Mountain field, and for delineating a CO2-saturated zone in the McElroy field. These inversion results suggested that the boundarypreserving inversion is able to provide better delineation of the top and base boundaries of the reservoir and boundaries of the CO2-saturated zone than the conventional smooth-constrained inversion.},

I separate the P- and S-waves in elastic media based on the Helmholtz decomposition. The decomposed wavefields based on this approach have the same amplitudes, units, and phases as the extrapolated wavefields. To avoid expensive multidimensional integrals in the Helmholtz decomposition, I introduce a fast Poisson solver to efficiently solve the vector Poisson's equation. This fast algorithm allows us to reduce computational complexity from O\dh N2\TH{} to O\dh N log N\TH, where N is the total number of grid points. Because the decomposed P- and S-waves are vector fields, I use vector imaging conditions to construct PP-, PS-, SS-, and SP-images. Several 2D numerical examples demonstrate that this approach allows us to accurately and efficiently decompose P- and S-waves in elastic media. In addition, elastic RTM images based on the vector imaging conditions have better quality and avoid polarity reversal in comparison with images based on the divergence and curl separation or direct component-by-component crosscorrelation.},

It is shown that the apparent incompatibility between the two is associated with the degeneracy of the dynamic problem when {$\omega$} = 0 and both can be handled uniformly using the Jordan canonical forms of matrices. We re-derive the propagator matrices for both the dynamic and static cases. We then show that the dynamic propagator matrix and the solution converge to their static counterparts as {$\omega$} \textrightarrow{} 0. Satisfactory static deformation can be obtained numerically using the dynamic solution at near-zero frequency.},
